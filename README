NAME
     Nextvi – A small vi/ex editor for editing bidirectional UTF-8 text

SYNOPSIS
     vi [-emsv] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Nextvi is a vi(1)-like text editor based on Ali Gholami Rudi's Neatvi(1).
     Invented Bill Joy in 1976, VI (Visual Editor) is a text editor that
     allows users to edit and manipulate text in a visual mode.	 It is a
     command-line editor that uses a set of keystrokes and commands to
     navigate and modify text. VI is a powerful and efficient editor that is
     widely used in Unix and Linux environments. It is known for its modal
     interface, where the user can switch between insert, command, and visual
     modes to perform different actions.It is also popular among developers
     and system administrators due to its flexibility and customization
     options. VI's syntax and command set are similar to those of other vi/ex
     editors, making it a versatile tool for users who are familiar with other
     text editors. 50 years later, I am pleased to present the superior vi
     implementation. Nextvi is a masterpiece, a symphony of efficiency and
     elegance. It boasts a blazing fast startup time, unrivaled portability
     and hackability, god powerful macro system and so much more.

EX
     Ex is a line editor for Unix systems originally written by Bill Joy in
     1976.  In ex, every command is prefixed with ':'. Ex is essential to vi
     which allows it to run commands and macros. Together vi and ex create a
     beautiful symbiosis which complements eath other and helps to solve
     various domain problems.

EX RANGES
     Some ex commands can be prefixed with ranges.
     Example: print lines 1,5
	     :1,5p
     Example: print 5 lines around xrow
	     :.-5,.+5p
     Example: print until int is found
	     :.,/int/p
     Example: print until int is found in reverse
	     :?int?,.p
	     Note: in some cases . can be dropped but is kept for readability.
     Example: print lines from mark d to mark a
	     :'d,'ap

EX COMMANDS
     f	     Ranged search (stands for find)

	     Example (no range given, current line only):
	     :f/int
	     or
	     :f?int
	     or (specified range)
	     :10,100f/int
	     Additionally, :f supports xoff (horizontal offset). This is
	     essential for scripting macros. Subsequent commands within the
	     range will move to the next match just like n/N.

     b	     Print currently active buffers and their state
     bp	     Set current buffer path
     bs	     Set current buffer saved. If arg given, reset undo/redo history
     p	     Print line(s) from the buffer

     ea	     Open file based on it's filename substring and from listing in
	     b-2

	     If the substring matches more than 1 filename, a prompt will
	     be shown. Submit using numbers 0-9 (higher ascii values work
	     too (^c to cancel)). Passing an extra arg to :ea in form of
	     a number will bypass the prompt and open the corresponding file.

     ea!     Forced version of ea
     a	     Enter ex append mode (exiting with ^c will discard changes)
     i	     Enter ex insert mode (exiting with ^c will discard changes)
     c	     Enter ex change mode (exiting with ^c will discard changes)
     d	     Delete a line
     e	     Open a file at path
     e!	     Reload the current buffer from FS

     g	     Global command

	     Same syntax as ex substitution command, but instead of replacement
	     string it takes an ex command after the / / enclosed regex.
	     Example: remove empty lines
	     :g/^$/d
	     Try doing similar with substitution command - will not work
	     as removing '\n' without deleting the line is invalid, but
	     it will work with global command. Multiple ex commands can be
	     chained in one global command.
	     In this case the ex separator has to be escaped once.
	     Example: yank matches and print them out.
	     :g/int/ya A\|p
	     If you wanted to get really fancy, it is possible to nest global
	     commands inside of global commands.
	     Example: find all lines with int and a semicolon and append "has a semicolon"
	     :g/int/:.g/;/tp A has a semicolon?

     g! v    Inverted global command
     =	     Move the cursor to a line number
     k	     Set a mark

     tp	     Global macro (stands for term_push)

	     It can run any vi normal command and execute insert statements.
	     The advantage of tp over traditional macros is in the ability
	     to bypass the macro queue and run independently. In a way, macro
	     executed by tp exercises the same causality as running C code
	     directly.

     pu	     Paste a register

	     :pu command can pipe the register to an external program by
	     specifying \! as a 2nd argument.

     q	     Soft quit
     q!	     Force quit

     r	     Read a file

	     To read data from a pipe use :r \!date

     w	     Soft write a to file

	     To pipe data to external process use :w \!less

     w!	     Force write a to file
     wq x    Write and soft quit
     wq! x!  Write and force quit
     u	     Undo
     rd	     Redo

     se	     Set a variable

	     Examples:
	     :se var=1
	     :se novar

     s	     Substitute

	     Basic usage:
	     :%s/term1/term2/g

	     Substitution backreference:
	     This inserts the text of matched group specified by \x where x is
	     group number. Example:
	     this is an example text for subs and has int or void
	     :%s/(int)\|(void)/pre\0after
	     this is an example text for subs and has preintafter or void
	     :%s/(int)\|(void)/pre\2after/g
	     this is an example text for subs and has prepreafterafter or prevoidafter

     ya	     Yank a region
     ya!     Reset register value
     !	     Run external program

     ft	     Set a filetype

	     Without filetype, prints the current file type. When filetype
	     is specified, sets the file type of the current ex buffer.
	     In nextvi :ft also reloads the highlight ft, which makes it
	     possible to reset dynamic highlights created by options like
	     "hlw".

     cm cm!  Keymap

	     Without kmap, prints the current keymap name. When kmap is specified,
	     sets the alternate keymap to kmap and, unless ! is given, switches
	     to this keymap.

     fd	     Set a secondary directory (stands for file dir)

	     Recalculates the directory listing for fssearch or :ea ex command.
	     No argument implies current directory.

     fp	     Set a secondary directory path (stands for file path)
     cd	     Set a working directory (stands for change dir)

     inc     Include regex for :fd calculation

	     Example 1:
	     We want to get only files in submodule directory that end with .c
	     extension:
	     :inc submodule.*\.c$
	     Example 2:
	     Exclude the .git and submodule folders.
	     :inc (^[\!.git\!submodule]+[^\/]+$)
	     Running "inc" without an arg will disable all filters.

     bx	     Set max number of buffers allowed (default is 10)

     ac	     Set autocomplete filter regex

	     Running ex command "ac" with no argument will reset back to
	     the default word filtering regex. You can find its string in
	     led.c as a reference.

     ic	     If set, ignore case in regular expressions.

	     +1	     Follow dircontexts[] (in conf.c), defaulting to left-to-
		     right.
	     -1	     Follow dircontexts[], defaulting to right-to-left.
	     -2	     Exclusively right-to-left.
