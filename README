NAME
     Nextvi â€“ A small vi/ex editor for editing bidirectional UTF-8 text

SYNOPSIS
     vi [-emsv] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Nextvi is a vi(1)-like text editor based on Ali Gholami Rudi's Neatvi(1).
     VI is a legendary command-line text editor, first introduced by Bill Joy
     in 1976, renowned for its modal interface, which allows users to switch
     between insert, command, and visual modes for seamless text manipulation.
     This powerful and efficient editor has stood the test of time, remaining
     a staple tool for developers and system administrators in Unix and Linux
     environments, thanks to its flexibility, customization options, and
     syntax similar to other vi/ex editors. To mark its 50th anniversary,
     Nextvi emerges as the pinnacle of VI's evolution. This masterpiece of
     efficiency and elegance boasts unparalleled startup speed, unmatched
     portability, exceptional hackability, and an incredibly robust macro
     system, among other features. Nextvi is truly the next generation of VI,
     ready to elevate your text editing experience.

VI MOTIONS
     Basic motion examples:
     3d/int  Delete text until the 3rd instance of "int" keyword
     d3w     Delete 3 words
     "ayl    Yank a character into 'a' register
     "Ayw    Append a word to 'a' register

EX
     Ex is a line editor for Unix systems originally written by Bill Joy in
     1976.  In ex, every command is prefixed with ':'. Ex is essential to vi,
     which allows it to run commands and macros. Together vi and ex create a
     beautiful symbiosis, which complements each other and helps to solve
     various domain problems.

EX EXPANSION
     Characters # and % in ex prompt substitute the buffer pathname.
     % substitutes current buffer and # last swapped buffer.
     It is possible to expand any arbitrary buffer by using % or
     # (no difference in this case) followed by the buffer number.
     Example:
     print the pathname for buffer 69 (if it exists).
     :!echo "%69"

     Every ex command is be able to receive data from the outside
     world through a special expansion character ! which runs a pipe
     command. If the closing ! is not specified, the end of the line
     becomes a terminator.
     Example:
     Substitute the value of env var $SECRET to the value of $RANDOM :).
     In this demo, we set the value of SECRET to "int" ourselves.
     :%s/!export SECRET="int" && printf "%s" $SECRET!/!printf "%s" $RANDOM! :)

EX ESCAPES
     Nextvi special character escapes work mostly the same way everywhere
     except the following situations:
      - Escapes in regex bracket expressions.
      - Due to ex expansion # % and ! characters have to be escaped
	if they are part of an ex command.
      - A single back slash requires 2 back slashes, and so on.
      - regex requires for ( to be escaped if used inside [] brackets.
      - In ex prompt the only separator is "|" character. It can
	be escaped normally but will require extra back slash if passed
	into a regular expression.

EX RANGES
     Some ex commands can be prefixed with ranges.
     :1,5p   print lines 1,5
     :.-5,.+5p
	     print 5 lines around xrow
     :.,/int/p
	     print until int is found
     :?int?,.p
	     print until int is found in reverse
	     Note: in some cases . can be dropped but is kept for readability.
     :'d,'ap
	     print lines from mark d to mark a

EX COMMANDS
     f	     Ranged search (stands for find)

	     Example (no range given, current line only):
	     :f/int
	     or
	     :f?int
	     or (specified range)
	     :10,100f/int
	     Additionally, :f supports xoff (horizontal offset). This is
	     essential for scripting macros. Subsequent commands within the
	     range will move to the next match just like n/N.

     b	     Print currently active buffers state or switch to a buffer

	     Switching to the 5th buffer:
	     :b5

	     There are 2 temporary buffers which are separate from
	     the main buffers.
	     b-1 = /hist/ ex history buffer
	     b-2 = /fm/ directory listing buffer
	     Switching to the temporary buffer buffer:
	     :b-1

     bp	     Set current buffer path
     bs	     Set current buffer saved. If arg given, reset undo/redo history
     p	     Print line(s) from the buffer

     ea	     Open file based on it's filename substring and from listing in
	     b-2

	     Requires directory listing in b-2 backfilled prior. This can
	     be done with:
	     :fd
	     or
	     :b-2|1,1!find .

	     If the substring matches more than 1 filename, a prompt will
	     be shown. Submit using numbers 0-9 (higher ascii values work
	     too (^c to cancel)). Passing an extra arg to :ea in form of
	     a number will bypass the prompt and open the corresponding file.

     ea!     Forced version of ea
     a	     Enter ex append mode (exiting with ^c will discard changes)
     i	     Enter ex insert mode (exiting with ^c will discard changes)
     c	     Enter ex change mode (exiting with ^c will discard changes)
     d	     Delete line(s)
     e	     Open a file at path
     e!	     Reload the current buffer from the filesystem

     g	     Global command

	     Same syntax as ex substitution command, but instead of replacement
	     string it takes an ex command after the / / enclosed regex.
	     Example: remove empty lines
	     :g/^$/d
	     Try doing similar with substitution command - will not work
	     as removing '\n' without deleting the line is invalid, but
	     it will work with global command. Multiple ex commands can be
	     chained in one global command.
	     In this case the ex separator has to be escaped once.
	     Example: yank matches appending to reg 'a' and print them out.
	     :g/int/ya A\|p
	     If you wanted to get really fancy, it is possible to nest global
	     commands inside of global commands.
	     Example: find all lines with int and a semicolon and append "has a semicolon"
	     :g/int/:.g/;/tp A has a semicolon?

     g! v    Inverted global command
     =	     Move the cursor to a line number
     k	     Set a mark

     tp	     Global macro (stands for term_push)

	     It can run any vi normal command and execute insert statements.
	     The advantage of tp over traditional macros is in the ability
	     to bypass the macro queue and run independently. In a way, macro
	     executed by tp exercises the same causality as running C code
	     directly.

     pu	     Paste a register

	     Any register can be piped to an external program by
	     specifying \! as a 2nd argument.
	     Example: copy default register to X11 clipboard
	     :pu \!xclip -selection clipboard

     q	     Soft quit
     q!	     Force quit

     r	     Read a file

	     To read data from a pipe use :r \!date

     w	     Soft write a to file

	     To pipe data to external process use :w \!less

     w!	     Force write a to file
     wq x    Write and soft quit
     wq! x!  Write and force quit
     u	     Undo
     rd	     Redo

     se	     Set a variable

	     Examples:
	     :se hll
	     :se nohll
	     Exact value:
	     :se hll=1
	     :se hll=0

     s	     Substitute

	     Basic usage:
	     :%s/term1/term2/g

	     Substitution backreference:
	     This inserts the text of matched group specified by \x where x is
	     group number. Example:
	     this is an example text for subs and has int or void
	     :%s/(int)\|(void)/pre\0after
	     this is an example text for subs and has preintafter or void
	     :%s/(int)\|(void)/pre\2after/g
	     this is an example text for subs and has prepreafterafter or prevoidafter

     ya	     Yank a region

	     To append to the register, pass in its uppercase version.
	     ya can append to any of the non-alphabetical registers by adding
	     any extra character to the command.
	     Example: append to register 1
	     :ya 1x

     ya!     Reset register value
     !	     Run external program

     ft	     Set a filetype

	     Without filetype, prints the current file type. When filetype
	     is specified, sets the file type of the current ex buffer.
	     In nextvi :ft also reloads the highlight ft, which makes it
	     possible to reset dynamic highlights created by options like
	     "hlw".

     cm cm!  Keymap

	     Without kmap, prints the current keymap name. When kmap is specified,
	     sets the alternate keymap to kmap and, unless ! is given, switches
	     to this keymap.

     fd	     Set a secondary directory (stands for file dir)

	     Recalculates the directory listing for fssearch or :ea ex command.
	     No argument implies current directory.

     fp	     Set a secondary directory path (stands for file path)
     cd	     Set a working directory (stands for change dir)

     inc     Include regex for :fd calculation

	     Example 1:
	     We want to get only files in submodule directory that end with .c
	     extension:
	     :inc submodule.*\.c$
	     Example 2:
	     Exclude the .git and submodule folders.
	     :inc (^[\!.git\!submodule]+[^\/]+$)
	     Running "inc" without an arg will disable all filters.

     reg     Print registers and their contents
     bx	     Set max number of buffers allowed (default is 10)

     ac	     Set autocomplete filter regex

	     Running ex command "ac" with no argument will reset back to
	     the default word filtering regex. You can find its string in
	     led.c as a reference.

     uc	     Toggle multibyte utf-8 decoding

	     This feature is particularly useful when editing files with
	     mixed encodings, binary files, or when the terminal does not
	     support UTF-8 or lacks the necessary fonts to display UTF-8
	     characters. Typically to be used along with :ph for the full
	     effect.

     ph	     Create new placeholders

	     Examples:
	     render 8 bit ascii (Extended ASCII) as '~':
	     :ph 128 255 1 1~
	     flawless ISO/IEC 8859-1 (latin-1) support:
	     :uc|ph 128 160 1 1~
	     reset to default as in conf.c:
	     :ph

EX OPTIONS
     ai	     If set, indent new lines.
     ic	     If set, ignore case in regular expressions.

     ish     Interactive shell

	     Makes every "!" pipe command run through an interactive shell
	     so that all shell features e.g. aliases work.

     grp     Regex search group

	     The following allows definition of target search group for /?nN,
	     autocomplete, ranged search, and ex substitution. This becomes
	     necessary when the result of regex search is to be based on
	     some group rather than default match group. For example you
	     want to search for the whole line but exclude the tabs at the
	     beginning of the line, use regex like this: [   ]+(.[^ ]+) since
	     only the capture result for 2nd group matters use the "grp"
	     like this: :se grp=2 .The number 2 is important, it is calculated
	     using: grpnum * 2. In this case grpnum is 1. The default grpnum
	     is always 0.

     hl	     If set, highlight text based on rules defined in conf.c.
     hll     If set, highlight current line.
     hlp     If set, highlight pairs of brackets.
     hlr     If set, highlight text in reverse direction.
     hlw     If set, highlight current word under the cursor.
     led     If unset, all terminal output is disabled.

     mpt     Control vi prompts

	     When set to 0 after an ex command is called from vi, disables
	     the "[any key to continue]" prompt. If mpt is negative, the
	     prompt will remain disabled.

     order   If set, reorder characters based on rules defined in conf.c.
     shape   If set, perform Arabic script letter shaping.
     pac     If set, print autocomplete suggestions on the fly.
     tbs     Number of spaces used to represent a tab.
     td	     Current text direction context.  This option accepts four
	     meaningful values:
	     +2	     Exclusively left-to-right.
	     +1	     Follow dircontexts[] (in conf.c), defaulting to left-to-
		     right.
	     -1	     Follow dircontexts[], defaulting to right-to-left.
	     -2	     Exclusively right-to-left.

     pr	     Print register

	     Set a special register using a character or a number. For instance,
	     :se pr=a will use the register 'a'. When the register is set,
	     all data passed into ex_print will be stored. If the register
	     is uppercase, new lines are added to match the exact output
	     that was printed. With this, internal editor state can be exported.
	     For example, printing the current buffers list with :b to a
	     file is possible.

EXINIT ENV VAR
     EXINIT can be used to achieve arbitrary level of customization.
     Using ex command "tp" any sequence of vi/ex commands can be
     performed at startup.

     To run examples below:
     There are invisible/non printing characters inside the EXINIT
     string. Visual copy paste in most programs will not copy it
     correctly. Copy it into a file and execute like this:
	     $ source ./init.sh
     The new line inside the EXINIT string is literal and is represented
     with "\n". To suppress EXINIT invoke vi like so: EXINIT= vi file
     When scripting for improved performance, output can be disabled
     by running :se noled and the initial load message can be suppressed
     using -m commandline.

     Example 1:
     There is a dictionary file (assume vi.c), which we always want to have indexed
     at startup for autocomplete.
     export EXINIT="e ./vi.c|tp i?|bx 1|bx"
     The last "bx" commands delete the vi.c buffer. To keep it around as a buffer
     remove the "bx" commands.
     Example 2:
     Load your shell's history into vi's history buffer and adjust the data such
     that it is usable by appending ! at the beginning of command and escaping the "|"
     pipes the way ex prompt expects them.
     export EXINIT=$'e /root/.ash_history|tp yG:?p:%s/^/\!\\|%s/ \| / \\\\\\| /g\nqq|bx 1|bx|ft'
     Congratulations, vi has unofficially replaced your shell's frontend.
     Example 3:
     Setup some custom @@ macros in your favorite registers.
     export EXINIT=$'e|tp io{\n}??kA|tp 1G|tp 2\"ayy'
     This macro gets loaded into register a, when @a is executed the macro will
     create { and closing } below the cursor leaving cursor in insert mode in
     between the braces. This is something you would commonly do in C like
     programming language.

REGEX
     Nextvi's regex syntax is akin to that of Plan 9.
     .	     match any single char
     ^	     assert start of the line
     $	     assert end of the line
     {N,M}   match N to M times
     ()	     grouping
     (?:)    non capture grouping
     [N-M]   match ranges N to M
     *	     repeated zero or more times
     +	     repeated one or more times
     |	     union, alternative branch
     \<	     assert beginning of the word
     \>	     assert end of the word
     ?	     one or zero matches greedy
     ??	     one or zero matches lazy

     Additionally, Nextvi's supports static lookahead expressions. For example
     [!abc] and [=abc] where ! is negated version of =. This will treat "abc"
     as (a && b && c) logically. It is possible to have multiple in one
     bracket expression as well. For example [!abc!cda!qwe] where each string
     delimited by the ! acts like a typical or operation i.e. [acq] with only
     difference of testing the extra characters ahead. To combine both
     standard bracket expression and lookahead in one, use ^ or ^= where ^ is
     negated and ^= is default. For example: [!abc^=123] characters after ^=
     match exactly how [123] would.

SPECIAL MARKS
     *	     position of the previous change
     [	     first line of the previous change
     ]	     last line of the previous change

SPECIAL REGISTERS
     /	     previous search keyword
     :	     previous ex command
     0	     previous value of default register (atomic)
	     Atomic means the operation did not include a whole line
	     and a \n character.
     1-9     previous value(s) of default register (nonatomic)

PHILOSOPHY
     In most text editors, flexibility is a minor or irrelevant design goal.
     Nextvi is designed to be flexible where the editor adapts to the user needs.
     This flexibility is achieved by heavily chaining basic commands and allowing
     them to create new ones with completely different functionality. Command
     reuse keeps the editor small without infringing on your freedom to quickly
     get a good grasp on the code. If you want to customize anything, you should
     be able to do it using the only core commands or a mix with some specific C
     code for more difficult tasks. Simple and flexible design allows for straight
     forward solutions to any problem long term and filters bad inconsistent ideas.

     Q: What is pikevm?
     A: Pikevm is a complete rewrite of nextvi's regex engine for the purposes of
     getting rid of backtracking and severe performance and memory constraints.
     Pikevm guarantees that all regular expressions are computed in constant space
     and O(n+k) time where n is size of the string and k is some constant for the
     complexity of the regex i.e. number of state transitions. It is important to
     understand that it does not mean that we run at O(n) linear speed, but rather
     the amount of processing time & memory usage is distributed evenly and linearly
     throughout the string, the k constant plays a big role. If you are familiar
     with radix sort algorithms this follows the same idea.
     Q: What are the other benefits?
     A: For example, now it is possible to compute a C comment /* n */ where n can
     be an infinite number of characters. Of course this extends to every other
     valid regular expression.
     Q: New features pikevm supports?
     A: Additionally, pikevm supports PCRE style non capture group (?:) and lazy
     quantifiers like .*? and .+?? because they were easy to implement and allow
     for further regex profiling/optimization.
     Q: NFA vs DFA (identify)
     A: pikevm = NFA backtrack = DFA
     Q: What's wrong with original implementation?
     A: Nothing except it being slow and limited. My improved version of Ali's DFA
     implementation ran 3.5X faster in any case, however I found a bug with it
     where zero quantifier "?" nested groups compute wrong submatch results. To
     fix this problem, it would require to undo a lot of optimization work already
     done, basically going back to how slow Ali's implementation would be. The reason
     this was spotted so late was because this kind of regex wasn't used before,
     so I never tested it. Other than that I think submatch extraction is correct
     on other cases. Pikevm does not have this bug, so it will be used as main
     regex engine from now on, unless dfa ever finds a proper fix. Honestly, this
     change isn't so surprising, as I was working on pikevm a few months prior, to
     favor a superior algorithm.
     You can still find that code here (likely with no updates):
     https://github.com/kyx0r/nextvi/tree/dfa_dead
     As a downside, NFA simulation loses the DFA property of being able to
     quickly short circuit a match, as everything runs linearly and at constant
     speed, incurring match time overhead. Well optimized DFA engine can
     outperform pikevm, but that is rather rare as they got problems of their own.
     For example as independently benchmarked, dfa_dead runs only 13% faster than
     pikevm and that is stretching the limit of what is physically possible on a
     table based matcher. Can't cheat mother nature, and if you dare to try she's
     unforgiving at best.
