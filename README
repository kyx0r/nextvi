NAME
     Nextvi – A small vi/ex editor for editing bidirectional UTF-8 text

SYNOPSIS
     vi [-emsv] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Nextvi is a vi(1)-like text editor based on Ali Gholami Rudi's Neatvi(1).
     VI is a legendary command-line text editor, first introduced by Bill Joy
     in 1976, renowned for its modal interface, which allows users to switch
     between insert, command, and visual modes for seamless text manipulation.
     This powerful and efficient editor has stood the test of time, remaining
     a staple tool for developers and system administrators in Unix and Linux
     environments, thanks to its flexibility, customization options, and
     syntax similar to other vi/ex editors. To mark its 50th anniversary,
     Nextvi emerges as the pinnacle of VI's evolution. This masterpiece of
     efficiency and elegance boasts unparalleled startup speed, unmatched
     portability, exceptional hackability, and an incredibly robust macro
     system, among other features. Nextvi is truly the next generation of VI,
     ready to elevate your text editing experience.

VI MOTIONS
     Basic motion examples:
     3d/int  Delete text until the 3rd instance of "int" keyword
     d3w     Delete 3 words
     "ayl    Yank a character into 'a' register
     "Ayw    Append a word to 'a' register

EX
     Ex is a line editor for Unix systems originally written by Bill Joy in
     1976.  In ex, every command is prefixed with ':'. Ex is essential to vi,
     which allows it to run commands and macros. Together vi and ex create a
     beautiful symbiosis, which complements each other and helps to solve
     various domain problems.

EX EXPANSION
     Characters # and % in ex prompt substitute the buffer pathname.
     % substitutes current buffer and # last swapped buffer.
     It is possible to expand any arbitrary buffer by using % or
     # (no difference in this case) followed by the buffer number.
     Example:
     print the pathname for buffer 69 (if it exists).
     :!echo "%69"

     Every ex command is be able to receive data from the outside
     world through a special expansion character ! which runs a pipe
     command. If the closing ! is not specified, the end of the line
     becomes a terminator.
     Example:
     Substitute the value of env var $SECRET to the value of $RANDOM :).
     In this demo, we set the value of SECRET to "int" ourselves.
     :%s/!export SECRET="int" && printf "%s" $SECRET!/!printf "%s" $RANDOM! :)

EX ESCAPES
     Nextvi special character escapes work mostly the same way everywhere
     except the following situations:
      - Escapes in regex bracket expressions.
      - Due to ex expansion # % and ! characters have to be escaped
	if they are part of an ex command.
      - A single back slash requires 2 back slashes, and so on.
      - regex requires for ( to be escaped if used inside [] brackets.
      - In ex prompt the only separator is "|" character. It can
	be escaped normally but will require extra back slash if passed
	into a regular expression.

EX RANGES
     Some ex commands can be prefixed with ranges.
     .	     current position
     ,	     vertical range separator
     ;	     horizontal range separator
     :1,5p   print lines 1,5
     :.-5,.+5p
	     print 5 lines around xrow
     :/int/p
	     print first occurance of int
     :?int?p
	     print first occurance of int in reverse
     :.,/int/p
	     print until int is found
     :?int?,.p
	     print until int is found in reverse
     :'d,'ap
	     print lines from mark d to mark a
     :%p     print all lines in the buffer
     :$p     print last line in the buffer
     :;50    goto character offset 50
     :10;50  goto line 10 character offset 50
     :10;.+5
	     goto line 10 +5 character offset
     :'a;'a  goto line mark a character offset a
     :;$     goto eol
     :5;/int/
	     search for int on line 5
     :.;?int?
	     search for int in reverse on the current line

EX COMMANDS
     f	     Ranged search (stands for find)

	     Example: no range given, current line only
	     :f/int
	     Example: reverse
	     :f?int
	     Example: range given
	     :10,100f/int
	     Subsequent commands within the range will move to the next match
	     just like vi n/N commands.

     b	     Print currently active buffers state or switch to a buffer

	     Example: switch to the 5th buffer
	     :b5

	     There are 2 temporary buffers which are separate from
	     the main buffers.
	     b-1 = /hist/ ex history buffer
	     b-2 = /fm/ directory listing buffer
	     Example: switch to the b-1 buffer
	     :b-1
	     Example: switch to the b-2 buffer
	     :b-2

     bp	     Set current buffer path
     bs	     Set current buffer saved. If arg given, reset undo/redo history

     p	     Print line(s) from the buffer

	     Example: utilize character offset ranges
	     :1,10;5;5p
	     Example: print current line from offset 5 to 10
	     :.;5;10p

     ea	     Open file based on it's filename substring and from listing in
	     b-2

	     Requires directory listing in b-2 backfilled prior.
	     Example: backfill b-2 using :fd
	     :fd
	     Example: backfill b-2 using find
	     :b-2|1,$!find .

	     If the substring matches more than 1 filename, a prompt will
	     be shown. Submit using numbers 0-9 (higher ascii values work
	     too (C-c to cancel)). Passing an extra arg to :ea in form of
	     a number will bypass the prompt and open the corresponding file.
	     Example: open filename containing "v"
	     :ea v
	     Example: open first match containing "v"
	     :ea v 0

     ea!     Forced version of ea

     a i c   Enter ex append/insert/change mode

	     Range determines the position.
	     Exiting with \n.\n or \nESC will apply changes to the buffer.
	     Exiting with C-c will discard changes.

     d	     Delete line(s)
     e	     Open a file at path
     e!	     Reload the current buffer from the filesystem

     g	     Global command

	     Execute an ex command on a range of lines that matches a //
	     enclosed regex.

	     Example: remove empty lines
	     :g/^$/d

	     Multiple ex commands can be chained in one global command.
	     To chain commands, the ex separator "|" must be escaped once.
	     Example: yank matches appending to reg 'a' and print them out.
	     :g/int/ya A\|p

	     It is possible to nest global commands inside of global commands.
	     Example: find all lines with int and a semicolon and append
	     "has a semicolon"
	     :g/int/:.g/;/tp A has a semicolon<^C>
	     Advanced example: extract/print data enclosed in ()
	     :g/\(.+\)/;0;/\(.+\)/\|.;.+1k a\|se grp=2\|;/\)*(\))/\|se nogrp\|k s\|.;'a;'sp

     g! v    Inverted global command
     =	     Print the current range linenumber
     k	     Set a mark

     tp	     Global macro (stands for term_push)

	     Run any sequence of vi/ex commands or macros.
	     The most common use case is to run macros inside EXINIT.
	     Example: execute ci(int macro
	     :tp ci(int
	     Example: execute ci(int exiting insert mode
	     :tp ci(int<^C>
	     Example: execute ci)INT as a follow-up
	     :tp ci(int<^C>ci)INT

     tp!     Global macro recursive

	     Unlike :tp the recursion is not terminated on the sequence end.
	     Intended use is to debug a :tp macro.

     pu	     Paste a register

	     To pipe register data to an external process use :pu \!<cmd>
	     Example: copy default register to X11 clipboard
	     :pu \!xclip -selection clipboard

     q	     Soft quit
     q!	     Force quit

     r	     Read a file

	     To read data from a file use :<range>r <filename>
	     To read data from a pipe use :<range>r \!<cmd>
	     Example: pipe in only the first line
	     :r \!ls
	     Example: pipe in only lines 3,5
	     :3,5r \!ls
	     Example: pipe in all data
	     :%r \!ls

     w	     Soft write to a file

	     To write data to a file use :<range>w <filename>
	     To pipe buffer data to external process use :<range>w \!<cmd>
	     Example: pipe out all data into less
	     :w \!less
	     Example: pipe out only first 10 lines
	     :1,10w \!less

     w!	     Force write to a file
     wq x    Write and soft quit
     wq! x!  Write and force quit
     u	     Undo
     rd	     Redo

     se	     Set a variable

	     Example: set using implications
	     :se hll
	     :se nohll
	     Example: set using exact values
	     :se hll=1
	     :se hll=0

     s	     Substitute

	     Find and replace text in a range of lines that matches a //
	     enclosed regex with a // enclosed replacement string.

	     Example: global replacement
	     :%s/term1/term2/g

	     Substitution backreference inserts the text of matched group
	     specified by \x where x is group number.

	     Example: substitution backreference
	     this is an example text for subs and has int or void
	     :%s/(int)\|(void)/pre\0after
	     this is an example text for subs and has preintafter or void
	     :%s/(int)\|(void)/pre\2after/g
	     this is an example text for subs and has prepreafterafter or prevoidafter

     ya	     Yank a region

	     To append to the register, pass in its uppercase version.
	     To append to any of the non-alphabetical registers add any extra
	     character to the command.
	     Example: append to register 1
	     :ya 1x

     ya!     Reset register value

     !	     Run external program

	     When ex range specified, pipes the buffer data to an external
	     process and pipes the output back into current buffer replacing
	     the affected range.
	     Example: infamously sort the buffer
	     :1,$!sort

     ft	     Set a filetype

	     No argument prints the current file type.
	     Reloads the highlight ft, which makes it possible to reset dynamic
	     highlights created by options like "hlw".

     cm	     Set a keymap

	     No argument prints the current keymap name.

     cm!     Set an alternative keymap

     fd	     Set a secondary directory (stands for file dir)

	     Recalculates the directory listing in b-2 buffer.
	     No argument implies current directory.

     fp	     Set a directory path for :fd (stands for file path)

     cd	     Set a working directory (stands for change dir)

	     Currently open buffers' file paths will be automatically adjusted
	     to reflect a newly set working directory.

     inc     Include regex for :fd calculation

	     Example: include only files in submodule directory that end with .c
	     :inc submodule.*\.c$
	     Example: exclude the .git and submodule folders
	     :inc (^[\!.git\!submodule]+[^\/]+$)
	     No argument disables the filter.

     reg     Print registers and their contents

     bx	     Set max number of buffers allowed

	     Buffers will be deallocated if the number specified is lower
	     than the number of buffers currently in use.
	     No argument will reset to the default value of 10.

     ac	     Set autocomplete filter regex

	     No argument resets to the default word filter regex as defined
	     in led.c.

     uc	     Toggle multibyte utf-8 decoding

	     This command is particularly useful when editing files with
	     mixed encodings, binary files, or when the terminal does not
	     support UTF-8 or lacks the necessary fonts to display UTF-8
	     characters. Typically to be used along with :ph for the full
	     effect.

     ph	     Create new placeholders

	     Examples:
	     render 8 bit ascii (Extended ASCII) as '~':
	     :ph 128 255 1 1~
	     flawless ISO/IEC 8859-1 (latin-1) support:
	     :uc|ph 128 160 1 1~
	     reset to default as in conf.c:
	     :ph

EX OPTIONS
     ai	     If set, indent new lines.
     ic	     If set, ignore case in regular expressions.

     ish     Interactive shell

	     Makes every "!" pipe command run through an interactive shell
	     so that all shell features e.g. aliases work.

     grp     Regex search group

	     Defines a target search group for any regex search operation.
	     This becomes necessary when the result of regex search is to
	     be based on some group rather than default match group.

	     Example: ignore tabs at the beginning of the line
	     :se grp=2|1,$f/^[	     ]+(.+)|se nogrp

	     The value of grp is calculated using (group number * 2).
	     The default group number is 0.

     hl	     If set, highlight text based on rules defined in conf.c.
     hlr     If set, highlight text in reverse direction.
     hll     If set and defined in hl, highlight current line.
     hlp     If set and defined in hl, highlight [](){} pairs.
     hlw     If set and defined in hl, highlight current word under the
	     cursor.
     led     If unset, all terminal output is disabled.

     mpt     Control vi prompts

	     When set to 0 after an ex command is called from vi, disables
	     the "[any key to continue]" prompt.
	     If mpt is negative, the prompt will remain disabled.

     order   If set, reorder characters based on rules defined in conf.c.
     shape   If set, perform Arabic script letter shaping.
     pac     If set, print autocomplete suggestions on the fly.
     tbs     Number of spaces used to represent a tab.
     td	     Current text direction context.  This option accepts four
	     meaningful values:
	     +2	     Exclusively left-to-right.
	     +1	     Follow dircontexts[] (in conf.c), defaulting to left-to-
		     right.
	     -1	     Follow dircontexts[], defaulting to right-to-left.
	     -2	     Exclusively right-to-left.

     pr	     Print register

	     Set a special register using a character or a number.
	     Once the register is set, all data passed into ex_print will
	     be stored in the register.
	     If the register is uppercase, new lines are added to match the
	     exact output that was printed.
	     Example: paste current buffer list exactly like from :b command
	     :se pr=A|ya! a|b|pu a
	     Example: store a line printed with :p
	     :se pr=A|ya! a|p

EXINIT ENV VAR
     EXINIT defines a sequence of vi/ex commands to be performed
     at startup. Consequently, this is the primary way for scripting
     and customizing nextvi outside of C.
     Many standard text processing utils such as grep, awk, sed
     can be replaced by nextvi with EXINIT in mind.

     Example 1:
     There is a dictionary file (assume vi.c), which we always want
     to have indexed at startup for autocomplete. The last "bx" commands
     delete the vi.c buffer.
     export EXINIT=$(printf "e ./vi.c|tp i\x7\x3|bx 1|bx")

     Example 2:
     Load some file (assume vi.c) into vi's history buffer.
     export EXINIT="b-1|%r ./vi.c|b-1"

     Example 3:
     Setup a @ macro in register a
     When @a is executed the macro will create { and closing } below
     the cursor leaving cursor in insert mode in between the braces.
     export EXINIT=$(printf "e|tp io{\n}\x16\x3kA\x3|tp 1G|tp 2\"ayy")

REGEX
     Nextvi's regex syntax is akin to that of Plan 9.
     .	     match any single char
     ^	     assert start of the line
     $	     assert end of the line
     {N,M}   match N to M times
     ()	     grouping
     (?:)    non capture grouping
     [N-M]   match ranges N to M
     *	     repeated zero or more times
     +	     repeated one or more times
     |	     union, alternative branch
     \<	     assert beginning of the word
     \>	     assert end of the word
     ?	     one or zero matches greedy
     ??	     one or zero matches lazy

     Additionally, Nextvi's supports static lookahead expressions. For example
     [!abc] and [=abc] where ! is negated version of =. This will treat "abc"
     as (a && b && c) logically. It is possible to have multiple in one
     bracket expression as well. For example [!abc!cda!qwe] where each string
     delimited by the ! acts like a typical or operation i.e. [acq] with only
     difference of testing the extra characters ahead. To combine both
     standard bracket expression and lookahead in one, use ^ or ^= where ^ is
     negated and ^= is default. For example: [!abc^=123] characters after ^=
     match exactly how [123] would.

SPECIAL MARKS
     *	     position of the previous change
     [	     first line of the previous change
     ]	     last line of the previous change

SPECIAL REGISTERS
     /	     previous search keyword
     :	     previous ex command
     0	     previous value of default register (atomic)
	     Atomic means the operation did not include a whole line
	     and a \n character.
     1-9     previous value(s) of default register (nonatomic)

PHILOSOPHY
     In most text editors, flexibility is a minor or irrelevant design goal.
     Nextvi is designed to be flexible where the editor adapts to the user needs.
     This flexibility is achieved by heavily chaining basic commands and allowing
     them to create new ones with completely different functionality. Command
     reuse keeps the editor small without infringing on your freedom to quickly
     get a good grasp on the code. If you want to customize anything, you should
     be able to do it using the only core commands or a mix with some specific C
     code for more difficult tasks. Simple and flexible design allows for straight
     forward solutions to any problem long term and filters bad inconsistent ideas.

     Q: What is pikevm?
     A: Pikevm is a complete rewrite of nextvi's regex engine for the purposes of
     getting rid of backtracking and severe performance and memory constraints.
     Pikevm guarantees that all regular expressions are computed in constant space
     and O(n+k) time where n is size of the string and k is some constant for the
     complexity of the regex i.e. number of state transitions. It is important to
     understand that it does not mean that we run at O(n) linear speed, but rather
     the amount of processing time & memory usage is distributed evenly and linearly
     throughout the string, the k constant plays a big role. If you are familiar
     with radix sort algorithms this follows the same idea.
     Q: What are the other benefits?
     A: For example, now it is possible to compute a C comment /* n */ where n can
     be an infinite number of characters. Of course this extends to every other
     valid regular expression.
     Q: New features pikevm supports?
     A: Additionally, pikevm supports PCRE style non capture group (?:) and lazy
     quantifiers like .*? and .+?? because they were easy to implement and allow
     for further regex profiling/optimization.
     Q: NFA vs DFA (identify)
     A: pikevm = NFA backtrack = DFA
     Q: What's wrong with original implementation?
     A: Nothing except it being slow and limited. My improved version of Ali's DFA
     implementation ran 3.5X faster in any case, however I found a bug with it
     where zero quantifier "?" nested groups compute wrong submatch results. To
     fix this problem, it would require to undo a lot of optimization work already
     done, basically going back to how slow Ali's implementation would be. The reason
     this was spotted so late was because this kind of regex wasn't used before,
     so I never tested it. Other than that I think submatch extraction is correct
     on other cases. Pikevm does not have this bug, so it will be used as main
     regex engine from now on, unless dfa ever finds a proper fix. Honestly, this
     change isn't so surprising, as I was working on pikevm a few months prior, to
     favor a superior algorithm.
     You can still find that code here (likely with no updates):
     https://github.com/kyx0r/nextvi/tree/dfa_dead
     As a downside, NFA simulation loses the DFA property of being able to
     quickly short circuit a match, as everything runs linearly and at constant
     speed, incurring match time overhead. Well optimized DFA engine can
     outperform pikevm, but that is rather rare as they got problems of their own.
     For example as independently benchmarked, dfa_dead runs only 13% faster than
     pikevm and that is stretching the limit of what is physically possible on a
     table based matcher. Can't cheat mother nature, and if you dare to try she's
     unforgiving at best.
