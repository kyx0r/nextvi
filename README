Nextvi(1)                   General Commands Manual                  Nextvi(1)

NAME
     Nextvi - A small vi/ex terminal text editor

SYNOPSIS
     vi [-emsv] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Nextvi is a modern clone of the command-line text editor vi(1),
     initially developed by Bill Joy in 1976 for Unix-based systems.
     Nextvi builds upon many standard features from vi(1) including
     unique modal interface that allows users to switch between normal,
     insert, and command modes, for efficient text manipulation.
     Additional enhancements include an unrestricted macro system,
     syntax highlighting, keymaps, bidirectional UTF-8 support, and
     numerous other features. Nextvi remains highly efficient, portable,
     and hackable, ensuring its continued relevance and high quality
     for years to come.

VI REGIONS
     Regions are vi normal commands that define [h v]range for vi motions.
     Commands described with the word "move" define a region.

     j + <^M> <Enter> - k h l f F t T , ; B E b e W w ( ) { } [ ] ^ 0 $
             <Space> <^H> <Backspace> % ' ` G H L M / ? n N <^A>

             All regions

VI MOTIONS
     Motions are vi normal commands that run in a [h v]range.
     Commands described with the word "region" consume a region.
     Motions can be prefixed or suffixed by [#].

     <^W> > < ! c d y " g~ gu gU
             All motions

     "       Special motions that consume a motion

     dd yy cc g~~ guu gUU >> << <^W><^W> !!
             Special motions that can use [#] as number of lines

     Examples:
     3d/int  Delete text until 3rd instance of "int" keyword
     3dw     Delete 3 words (prefix [#])
     d3w     Delete 3 words (suffix [#])
     "ayl    Yank a character into <a> register
     "Ayw    Append a word to <a> register

VI/EX INSERT

     <^N>          Loop through autocomplete options forward
     <^B>          Print autocomplete options when in vi insert
     <^B>          Recurse into b-1 history buffer when in ex prompt. Insert
                   current line into ex prompt on exit
     <^A>          Loop through lines in a history buffer b-1
     <^Z>          Suspend vi/ex
     <^L>          Redraw screen in vi mode, clean terminal in ex

     <^M>
     <Enter>
                   Insert <Newline> in vi, submit command in ex

EX
     Ex is a powerful line editor for Unix systems, initially developed
     by Bill Joy in 1976. This essential tool serves as the backbone
     of vi, enabling it to execute commands, macros and even transform
     into a purely command-line interface (CLI) when desired.

EX PARSING
     Parsing follows the structure:
     [<sep>][range][pad][cmd][<pad>][args]
     Ex commands are initiated and separated by <:> prefix. Fields
     can be padded by <Space> or <Tab>. There can only be one pad
     in between [cmd] and [args]. To avoid ambiguity in scripts, it
     is recommended to always use a pad between [cmd] and [args].

     Examples:
     :evi.c
             Evaluates to ":e vi.c"
     :eabc
             Evaluates to ":ea bc" not ":e abc"
     :e  vi.c
             Edit " vi.c". <pad> is required

EX ESCAPES
     Special characters in [args] will become regular when escaped
     with <\>.

     ( ^ ] -
             Specials in regex "[]" expression
     ( ) { } + * ? ^ $ [ ] | \ . \< \>
             Specials in regex
     % ! :   Specials in ex

EX EXPANSION
     <%> in [args] substitutes current buffer pathname or any buffer
     pathname when followed by a corresponding buffer number.
     "%#" substitutes last swapped buffer pathname.

     Example: print pathname for buffer 69
     :!echo "%69"

     Every ex command is be able to receive stdout from an external
     program via a special expansion character <!>.
     If closing <!> was not specified, the end of the line becomes
     a terminator.

     Example: substitute "int" with the value of $RANDOM
     :%s/int/!printf "%s" $RANDOM!
     Example: insert output of ls shell command
     :& i!ls
     Example: insert output of ls more efficiently
     :;c !ls!<^V><ESC>

EX RANGES
     Some ex commands can be prefixed with ranges.
     [range] implements vertical and horizontal ranges.
     [vrange] implements vertical range and horizontal position.

     [pad][%][, ;][pad][. $ ' > <][- + * / %][0-9]
             All ranges structure
     {> <}[kwd][> <]
             Search range structure
     '{<mark>}
             Mark range structure

     pad     <Space> or <Tab>
     %       Range from first to last line
     ,       Vertical range separator
     ;       Horizontal range separator
     .       Current position
     $       Last line of a buffer or end of line
     '       Begin mark range
     >       Begin search range forward
     <       Begin search range backward
     -       Subtract following number
     +       Add following number
     *       Multiply by the following number
     /       Divide by the following number
     %       Modulo by the following number
     0-9     Number or position

     Examples:
     :1,5p   Print lines 1,5
     :.-5,.+5p
             Print 5 lines around current position
     :>int>p
             Print first occurrence of "int"
     :<int<p
             Print first occurrence of "int" in reverse
     :.,>int>p
             Print until "int" is found
     :<int<,.p
             Print until "int" is found in reverse
     :>      Search using previously set search keyword
     :'d,'ap
             Print lines from mark <d> to mark <a>
     :%p     Print all lines in a buffer
     :$p     Print last line in a buffer
     :$*50/100+1
             Goto 50% of the file
     :;50    Goto character offset 50
     :10;50  Goto line 10 character offset 50
     :10;.+5
             Goto line 10 +5 character offset
     :'a;'a  Goto line mark <a> offset mark <a>
     :;$     Goto end of line
     :5;>int>
             Search for "int" on line 5
     :.;<int<
             Search for "int" in reverse on the current line
     :;>int>+3;>>p
             Print text enclosed by "int" on the current line

EX COMMANDS
     [vrange]f{> <}[kwd]
             Ranged search

             Example: no range given, current line only
             :f>int
             Example: reverse
             :f<int
             Example: range given
             :10,100f>int

     [vrange]f+{> <}[kwd]
             Incrementing ranged search

             Equivalent to the :f command, except subsequent commands within
             range move to the next match just like vi normal [#]n or [#]N
             commands.

     b[#]    Print buffers or switch to a buffer

             There are two temporary buffers which are separate from
             the main buffers.
             b-1 = /hist/ ex history buffer
             b-2 = /fm/ directory listing buffer

             Example: switch to the 5th buffer
             :b5
             Example: switch to the b-1 buffer
             :b-1
             Example: switch to the b-2 buffer
             :b-2

     bp[path]
             Set current buffer path

     bs[*]   Set current buffer saved

             Argument resets undo/redo history

     [range]p
             Print line(s) from a buffer

             Example: utilize character offset ranges
             :1,10;5;5p
             Example: interleaved character offset ranges
             :1;5,10;5p
             Example: print current line from offset 5 to 10
             :.;5;10p

     [#]ea[kwd]
             Open file based on filename substring

             Requires directory listing in b-2 backfilled prior.

             Example: backfill b-2 using :fd
             :fd
             Example: backfill b-2 using find
             :b-2:%!find .

             If kwd matches more than one filename, a list of matches
             and a fuzzy find prompt will be shown. If the number of matches
             is less than 10, match can be picked using numbers 0-9.
             <^C> or <ESC> to abort.
             <^M> or <Enter> to input a number larger than 9.
             Prefix is a number selected ahead of time.

             Example: print entire listing
             :ea
             Example: open filename containing "v"
             :ea v
             Example: open path at index 15
             :15ea

     [#]ea![kwd]
             Forced version of ea

     [vrange]i[str]
             Enter ex insert mode before specified position

             str specifies initial input into the insertion buffer.

             Example: insert "hello" in vi/ex
             :i hello<^M><ESC>
             Example: insert "hello" in vi/ex trimming <Newline>
             :i hello<^M><^M><Backspace>
             Example: discard changes in vi/ex
             :i hello<^M><^C>
             Example: immediately insert "hello"
             :i hello<^V><ESC>
             Example: insert "hello" in raw ex mode
             i hello<^M>.<^M>

     [vrange]a[str]
             Enter ex insert mode after specified position

     [range]c[str]
             Enter ex change mode

             In combination with seq and lim ex options, this command is
             optimal for modifying very long lines.
             Max insertion buffer is ~1.33GB on a 32 bit build.
             Max addressable line is 2.0GB on a 32 bit build.

             Example: replace current line with "hello"
             :c hello<^M><ESC>
             Example: replace lines 1-5 with "hello"
             :1,5c hello<^M><ESC>
             Example: insert "hello" at current character offset
             :;c hello<^M><ESC>
             Example: insert "hello" at end of line
             :;$c hello<^M><ESC>
             Example: insert "hello" at line 5 and end of line
             :5;$c hello<^M><ESC>
             Example: delete 5 characters from current position
             :;.;+5c<^M><ESC>

     [vrange]d
             Delete line(s)
     e[path]
             Open a file at a path

             No argument opens "unnamed" buffer.
             Files larger than 2.0GB are truncated on a 32 bit build.
             Line breaking happens until the first null terminator or EOF.
     e![path]
             Force open a file at a path

             No argument re-reads the current buffer from the filesystem.

     [vrange]g{<*>}[kwd]{<*>}{cmd}
             Global command

             Execute an ex command on a range of lines that matches an
             enclosed regex.

             No range evaluates to <%> range or <.> range when nested.

             Example: remove all empty lines
             :g/^$/d

             Example: print lines matching previously set search keyword
             :g//p

             Multiple ex commands can be chained in one global command.
             To chain commands, the ex separator <:> must be escaped once.

             Example: print and append lines matching "int" to register <a>
             :g/int/p\:ya ax

             It is possible to nest global commands inside of global commands.
             The first global command will not be executed on lines that
             were changed by a nested global command.

             Example: nested global command
             Append "has a semicolon" to all lines that contain "int" and
             end with <;>.
             :g/int/g/;$/& A has a semicolon

             Example: extract/print data enclosed in "()"
             :g/\(.+\)/;0;>\(.+\)>\:.;.+1k a\:grp 2\:;>\)*(\))>\:
             grp\:k s\:.;'a;'sp

     [vrange]g!{<*>}[kwd]{<*>}{cmd}
             Inverted global command
     [range]=[<0-3 *>][*]
             Print range numbers

             Argument 0-3 selects a specific number.
             Any or any extra argument circumvents buffer range check.
             No argument prints all range numbers.

             Example: print current character offset only
             :;= 2
             Example: print value of mark <a>
             :'a=
             Example: calculate 75 - 100
             :1,75-100=1p

     [vrange]k{<mark>}
             Set a line mark

             Valid marks: <a-z> <`> <'> <[> <]> <*>
             The character offset is set to the current position.

     &{macro}
             Global non-blocking macro

             Execute raw vi/ex input sequence.
             A non-blocking macro shall not wait for input when the end of
             the sequence is reached. A non-blocking macro executing other
             macros will always reach a terminating point.

             Example: execute vi insert statement
             :& ihello
             Example: execute :hello
             :& \:hello<^V><^M>
             Example: execute vi "ci(int" macro
             :& ci(int
             Example: nest blocking macro inside non-blocking
             :& \:@ \\:blocking<^V><^M>i continue in non-blocking
             Example: enable permanent vi line numbers
             :& 2#

     @{macro}
             Global blocking macro

             Execute raw vi/ex input sequence.
             A blocking macro shall wait for input when the end of the sequence
             is reached. A blocking macro executing other macros may cause
             input congestion.

             Example: execute vi insert statement
             :@ ihello
             Example: insert "hello" into <:> vi prompt
             :@ \:hello
             Example: execute vi "ci(int" macro
             :@ ci(int
             Example: execute "ci(int" exiting insert mode
             :@ ci(int<^V><^C>
             Example: execute "ci)INT" as a follow-up
             :@ ci(int<^V><^C>ci)INT
             Example: execute vi "dw" command after user exits insert
             :@i:@dw

     [#0 <$>][,{#1 <$>}][,{#2 <$>}]?{cmd}
             While loop conditional

             Repeat cmd #0 times or infinite with <$>.
             While loop is broken once cmd returns an error or count exceeded.
             If while fails with error, #1 and #2 specify a range of the separated
             ex commands to skip that follow next in chain.
             No prefix creates a conditional with all # parameters set to 1.

             Example: attempt to join every line in file using arbitrary count
             :10000? & J
             Example: undo everything
             :$? u
             Example: repeat chain of ex commands 10 times
             :10? 1p\:5p\:10p
             Example: calculate directory only if :cd succeeded
             :? cd /blah:fd
             Example: print a line only if it contains "int" at offset 5
             :? ;5;>^int>:p
             Example: allow :led while branching only :p command
             :led:1,2? ;5;>^int>:led:p
             Example: branch multiple commands
             :led:1,2,3? ;5;>^int>:led:&i2 not branched:p:p
             Example: edit vi.c only if it exists
             :? \![ -f ./vi.c ]:e ./vi.c:mpt

     [range]pu[<reg>][*][\!{cmd}]
             Paste or pipe a register

             Example: paste <a> at line 1 character offset 5
             :1;5pu a
             Example: copy default register to X11 clipboard
             :pu \!xclip -selection clipboard
             Example: copy register <a> to X11 clipboard
             :pu a \!xclip -selection clipboard

     [range]r[path]
     [range]r[\!{cmd}]
             Read a file or a pipe

             Range is computed on a target.
             No range evaluates to <%> range.
             No argument evaluates to current buffer path.

             Example: read a file
             :r vi.c
             Example: pipe in all data
             :r \!ls
             Example: pipe in only lines 3,5
             :3,5r \!ls

     [range]w[path]
     [range]w[\!{cmd}]
             Write a file or a pipe

             No range evaluates to <%> range.
             No argument evaluates to current buffer path.

             Example: write a file
             :w vi.c
             Example: pipe out all data into less
             :w \!less
             Example: pipe out only first 10 lines
             :1,10w \!less

     [vrange]s{<*>}[kwd]{<*>}{str}[<*>][<g>]
             Substitute

             Find and replace text in a range of lines that matches an
             enclosed regex with an enclosed replacement string.

             Example: global replacement
             :%s/term1/term2/g

             Example: replace matching previously set search keyword
             :%s//term2/g

             Substitution backreference inserts the text of matched group
             specified by \x where x is group number.

             Example: substitution backreference
             this is an example text for subs and has int or void
             :%s/(int)|(void)/pre\0after
             this is an example text for subs and has preintafter or void
             :%s/(int)|(void)/pre\2after/g
             this is an example text for subs and has prepreafterafter or prevoidafter

     [range]ya[<reg>][*]
             Yank into a register

             Argument value range is 0x1-0xff and 0x0 without.
             Any extra argument appends to the register.
             Default register 0x0 cannot be appended to.

             Example: append to register <1>
             :ya 1x
             Example: yank into <a> using ranges
             :1,5;5;5ya a

     ya![<reg>]
             Free a register

     [range]![cmd]
             Run an external program

             When a range is specified, the buffer's data is piped to an external
             program. The resulting stdout is then piped back into the buffer,
             replacing the contents of the original range.

             Example: infamously sort a buffer
             :%!sort
             Example: use sed to replace "int" with "uint"
             :%!sed -e 's/int/uint/g'
             Example: pipe in result of ls command without replace
             :;$+1!ls
             Example: capitalize word at current position using tr
             :;.;>\\>>!tr '[\:lower\:]' '[\:upper\:]'

     ft[filetype]
             Set a filetype

             No argument prints the current file type.
             Reloads the highlight ft, which makes it possible to reset dynamic
             highlights created by options like "hlw".

     cm[keymap]
             Set a keymap

             No argument prints the current keymap name.

     cm![keymap]
             Set an alternative keymap

     fd[path]
             Set a secondary directory

             Recalculates directory listing in b-2 buffer.
             No argument implies current directory.

     fp[path]
             Set a directory path for :fd command

     cd[path]
             Set a working directory

             Currently open buffers' file paths will be automatically adjusted
             to reflect a newly set working directory.

     inc[regex]
             Include regex for :fd calculation

             No argument disables the filter.

             Example: include only files in submodule directory that end with .c
             :inc submodule.*\.c$
             Example: exclude .git and submodule folders
             :inc (^(?\:(?\!^\.git|^submodule).)+[^/]+$)

     reg     Print registers and their contents

     bx[#]   Set max number of buffers allowed

             Buffers will be deallocated if the number specified is lower
             than the number of buffers currently in use.
             No argument will reset to the default value of 10.

     ac[regex]
             Set autocomplete filter regex

             No argument resets to the default word filter regex as defined
             in led.c.

             Example: autocomplete using whole lines from a buffer
             :ac .+

     uc      Toggle multibyte utf-8 decoding

             This command is particularly useful when editing files with
             mixed encodings, binary files, or when the terminal does not
             support UTF-8 or lacks the necessary fonts to display UTF-8
             characters. It's often paired with :ph command to achieve
             hex editor-like functionality.

     uz      Toggle zero width placeholders

             Use only if you need to hide zero width characters.

     ub      Toggle combining multicodepoint placeholders

             Use only if your terminal can render multicodepoint utf-8 (emojis).

     ph[#clow] [#chigh] [#width] [#blen][*char]
             Redefine placeholders

             This command replaces placeholders defined in conf.c
             and subsequent :ph commands expand the list of placeholders.

             Example: render 8 bit ascii (Extended ASCII) as <~>
             :ph 128 255 1 1~
             Example: flawless ISO/IEC 8859-1 (latin-1) support
             :uc:ph 128 160 1 1~
             Example: render control byte 03 as "^C"
             :ph 3 3 2 1^C
             Example: reset to default as in conf.c
             :ph
             Example: disable default placeholders in conf.c
             :ph:ph0

EX OPTIONS
     Ex options are ex commands designed to alter global variables.
     Values hold a signed integer. Values may represent a character.
     Default value is specified in val=* as part of an argument notation.
     No argument inverts the current value, unless stated otherwise.

     ai[val=1]
             Indent new lines

             This is a max indent length multiplier: val * 128
     ic[val=1]
             Ignore case in regular expressions

     ish[val=0]
             Interactive shell

             Run every <!> command through an interactive shell.
             The shell will source the .rc file before command execution.
             This makes it possible to use predefined functions, aliases
             and ENV variables from the .rc file.
             Precondition 1:
                     The .rc filename is shell specific, such as .bashrc in Bash
                     and .zshrc in Zsh.
             Precondition 2:
                     The environment variable $SHELL determines the default
                     shell, otherwise it defaults to /bin/sh.
             Precondition 3:
                     There must be no stdout output created by .rc file
                     for <!> commands to return expected results.

     grp[val=0]
             Regex search group

             Defines a target search group for any regex search operation.
             This becomes necessary when the result of regex search is to
             be based on some group rather than default match group.

             The value of grp must be divisible by 2.

             Example: ignore spaces at the start of the line
             :grp 2:%f+>^[ ]+(.+):grp

     hl[val=1]
             Highlight text based on rules defined in conf.c
     hlr[val=0]
             Highlight text in reverse direction
     hll[val=0]
             Highlight current line based on filetype hl
     hlp[val=0]
             Highlight "[]" "()" "{}" pairs based on filetype hl
     hlw[val=0]
             Highlight current word based on filetype hl
     led[val=1]
             Enable all terminal output

     vis[val=0]
             Control startup flags

             Example: disable :e message in ex mode
             :vis 12
             Example: disable :e message in vi mode
             :vis 8
             Example: enable raw ex mode
             :vis 6
             Example: disable raw ex mode
             :vis 4

     mpt[val=0]
             Control vi prompts

             When set to 0 after an ex command is called from vi, disables
             the "[any key to continue]" prompt.
             If mpt is negative, the prompt will remain disabled.

     order[val=1]
             Reorder characters based on rules defined in conf.c
     shape[val=1]
             Perform Arabic script letter shaping
     pac[val=0]
             Print autocomplete suggestions on the fly
     tbs[val=8]
             Number of spaces used to represent a tab
     td[val=1]
             Current text direction context

             This option accepts four meaningful values:
             2       Exclusively left-to-right
             1       Follow dctxs[] (in conf.c), defaulting to left-to-right
             -1      Follow dctxs[], defaulting to right-to-left
             -2      Exclusively right-to-left

     pr[val=0]
             Print register

             Set a special register using a character or a number.
             Once the register is set, all data passed into ex_print will
             be stored in the register.

             If the register is uppercase, <Newline> characters are added
             to match the exact output that was printed.

             Print register contents cannot be displayed with R or :reg command
             when register is assigned (self-referential problem).

             Example: paste current buffer list exactly like from :b command
             :pr A:ya! A: b:pu A
             Example: store a line printed with :p
             :pr A:ya! A:p

     sep[val=:]
             Ex separator

             Set Ex command separator character.
             Changing default <:> separator will break some built-in commands/macros.
             Example: set separator to <|>
             :sep |
             Example: disable separator
             :sep 0

     lim[val=-1]
             Line length render limit

             Set render cutoff length for non cursor lines in vi and all
             lines in ex mode.

             Improves redraw performance when editing a file containing one
             or many long lines (1MB+ per line).

             Example: reasonable value
             :lim 5000
             Example: render only the cursor line
             :lim 0
             Example: disable the limit
             :lim -1

     seq[val=1]
             Control Undo/Redo

             When seq is 0, multiple distinct operations undo/redo in a
             single step.

             To optimize memory usage under heavy workloads, undo/redo
             tracking can be disabled by setting seq to a negative value.

             Example: test undo/redo operations in a single step
             :&ocontrol test:seq 0:&a step1:&a step2:&a step3:seq
             Example: completely disable undo/redo
             :seq -1

     [hscroll]left[val=0]
             Control horizontal scroll

             No argument sets the value to 0.
             hscroll computes the value using: xcols / 2 * hscroll

EXINIT ENV VAR
     EXINIT defines a sequence of vi/ex commands to be performed
     at startup. Consequently, this is the primary way for scripting
     and customizing Nextvi outside of C.
     Many standard text processing utils such as grep, awk, sed
     can be replaced by Nextvi with EXINIT in mind.

     Examples:

     export EXINIT="$(printf '%b' 'e ./vi.c:& i\x7\x3:bx 1:bx')"
             Index vi.c for autocomplete

     export EXINIT='b-1:r ./vi.c:b-1'
             Load vi.c into a history buffer

     export EXINIT="$(printf '%b' 'e:& io{\n}\x16\x3kA\x3:& 1G:& 2"aY')"
             Setup @ macro in register <a>

             @a macro creates <{> and closing <}> below the cursor leaving
             cursor in insert mode in between the braces.

     export EXINIT='td 2:order 0:lim 5000'
             Set ex options for optimal long line performance

REGEX
     Pikevm is a fast non backtracking NFA simulation regex engine
     developed for Nextvi. It ensures regular expressions are evaluated
     in constant space and O(n + k) time complexity where <n> is
     the input string length and <k> represents the regex's structural
     complexity (e.g., state transitions or alternations). While
     this does not guarantee strict O(n) linear runtime performance,
     it ensures computational and memory resources are distributed
     linearly and evenly across the input, with <k> directly influencing
     the constant factor. This principle is similar to the concept
     utilized in radix sort algorithms.

     Pikevm's syntax is akin to regexp(7) from Plan 9.
     Disregard manpage notation in this section.

     .       Match any single char
     [N-M]   Match a set of alternate ranges N to M
     {N,M}   Match N to M times
     ()      Grouping
     (?:)    Non capture grouping
     *       Repeated zero or more times
     +       Repeated one or more times
     |       Union, alternative branch
     ?       One or zero matches greedy
     ??      One or zero matches lazy
     ^       Assert start of line
     $       Assert end of line
     \<      Assert start of word
     \>      Assert end of word
     (?=)    Assert positive lookahead
     (?!)    Assert negative lookahead
     (?>)    Assert positive lookbehind
     (?<)    Assert negative lookbehind
     (?#)    Lookbehind offset in bytes

     Lookaround expressions enable the creation of regular expressions
     that would be impossible to construct without them. They can
     be used anywhere within a regex, though some considerations
     must be taken into account.
     Aspect 1:
             Lookarounds contain a full regex, but should use non-capturing
             groups to avoid incorrect results and performance issues.
     Aspect 2:
             Lookarounds can have nested lookarounds.
     Aspect 3:
             Static lookarounds like (?=^word) are optimized, bypassing
             the regex engine.
     Aspect 4:
             Lookarounds are best suited for asserting near the end of a
             complex pattern, where the engine has already narrowed down
             potential matches.
     Aspect 5:
             Lookbehind without offset or 0 offset begins at previous character.
             Offset begins scanning from current position minus specified
             value. Negative offset begins at the start of the string.

SPECIAL MARKS
     *       Position of previous ex command
     [       First line of previous change
     ]       Last line of previous change
     '       Position of previous line region
     `       Position of previous line region

SPECIAL REGISTERS
     /       Previous search keyword
     :       Previous ex command
     0       Previous value of default register (atomic)
             Atomic means the operation did not include a <Newline>.
     1-9     Previous value(s) of default register (nonatomic)

PHILOSOPHY
     In most text editors, flexibility is a minor or irrelevant design
     goal. Nextvi is designed to be flexible where the editor adapts
     to the user needs. This flexibility is achieved by heavily chaining
     basic commands and allowing them to create new ones with completely
     different functionality. Command reuse keeps the editor small
     without infringing on your freedom to quickly get a good grasp
     on the code. If you want to customize anything, you should be
     able to do it using only core commands or a mix with some specific
     C code for more difficult tasks. Simple and flexible design
     allows for straight forward solutions to any problem long term
     and filters bad inconsistent ideas.
