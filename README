Nextvi(1)                   General Commands Manual                  Nextvi(1)

NAME
     Nextvi - A small vi/ex terminal text editor

SYNOPSIS
     vi [-emsv] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Nextvi is a modern clone of the command-line text editor vi(1),
     initially developed by Bill Joy in 1976 for Unix-based systems.
     Nextvi builds upon many standard features from vi(1) including
     unique modal interface that allows users to switch between normal,
     insert, and command modes, for efficient text manipulation.
     Additional enhancements include an unrestricted macro system,
     syntax highlighting, keymaps, bidirectional UTF-8 support, and
     numerous other features. Nextvi remains highly efficient, portable,
     and hackable, ensuring its continued relevance and high quality
     for years to come.

VI REGIONS
     Regions are vi normal commands that define [h v]range for vi motions.
     Commands described with the word "move" define a region.

     <+ j ^M Newline - k h l f F t T , ; B E b e W w { } [ ] ^ 0 $ Space ^H
             Backspace % ' ` G H L M / ? n N ^A>

             All regions

VI MOTIONS
     Motions are vi normal commands that run in a [h v]range.
     Commands described with the word "region" consume a region.

     <^W < > ! c d y "> g~ gu gU
             All motions

     <">     Special motions that consume a motion

     dd yy cc g~~ guu gUU >> << <^W><^W> !!
             Special motions that can use [#] as number of lines

     Examples:
     3d/int  Delete text until the 3rd instance of "int" keyword
     d3w     Delete 3 words
     "ayl    Yank a character into <a> register
     "Ayw    Append a word to <a> register

     <^Y>          Reset autocomplete data
     <^R>          Loop through autocomplete options backward
     <^N>          Loop through autocomplete options forward
     <^B>          Print autocomplete options when in vi insert
     <^B>          Recurse into b-1 history buffer when in ex prompt. Insert
                   current line into ex prompt on exit
     <^A>          Loop through lines in a history buffer b-1
     <^Z>          Suspend vi/ex

EX
     Ex is a powerful line editor for Unix systems, initially developed
     by Bill Joy in 1976. This essential tool serves as the backbone
     of vi, enabling it to execute commands, macros and even transform
     into a purely command-line interface (CLI) when desired.

EX PARSING
     Parsing follows the structure:
     [<:>][range][sep][cmd][<sep>][args][<:>]
     Ex commands are initiated and separated by <:> prefix. Fields
     can be separated by <Space> or <Tab>. There can only be one separator
     in between [cmd] and [args]. To avoid ambiguity, it is recommended
     to always use a separator between [cmd] and [args] in scripts.

     Examples:
     :evi.c
             Evaluates to ":e vi.c"
     :eabc
             Evaluates to ":ea bc" not ":e abc"
     :e  vi.c
             Edit " vi.c". [<sep>] is required

EX ESCAPES
     Special characters in [args] will become regular when escaped
     with <\>.

     <( ^ ! = [ ] \>
             Special characters in regex "[]" bracket exp
     <( ) { } + * ? ^ $ [ ] | \< \> . \>
             Special characters in regex
     <# % ! :>
             Special characters in ex

EX EXPANSION
     Characters <# %> in [args] substitute the buffer pathname.
     <%> substitutes current buffer and <#> last swapped buffer.
     It is possible to expand any arbitrary buffer by using <# %>
     followed by the buffer number.

     Example: print the pathname for buffer 69.
     :!echo "%69"

     Every ex command is be able to receive data from external process
     through a special expansion character <!> which pipes the data
     into the command itself. If the closing <!> is not specified,
     the end of the line becomes a terminator.

     Example: Substitute "int" with the value of $RANDOM
     :%s/int/!printf "%s" $RANDOM!
     Example: Insert output of ls shell command
     :& i!ls

EX RANGES
     Some ex commands can be prefixed with ranges.

     [. - +][1-9 %][sep][, ;][. - +][1-9 $]
             Numeric ranges
     </ ?>{kwd}[</ ?>]
             Search ranges
     <'>{mark}
             Mark ranges

     Examples:
     .       current position
     ,       vertical range separator
     ;       horizontal range separator
     :1,5p   print lines 1,5
     :.-5,.+5p
             print 5 lines around xrow
     :/int/p
             print first occurrence of int
     :?int?p
             print first occurrence of int in reverse
     :.,/int/p
             print until int is found
     :?int?,.p
             print until int is found in reverse
     :'d,'ap
             print lines from mark <d> to mark <a>
     :%p     print all lines in the buffer
     :$p     print last line in the buffer
     :;50    goto character offset 50
     :10;50  goto line 10 character offset 50
     :10;.+5
             goto line 10 +5 character offset
     :'a;'a  goto line mark <a> offset mark <a>
     :;$     goto end of the line
     :5;/int/
             search for int on line 5
     :.;?int?
             search for int in reverse on the current line

EX COMMANDS
     [range]f{/?}[kwd]
             Ranged search (stands for find)

             Example: no range given, current line only
             :f/int
             Example: reverse
             :f?int
             Example: range given
             :10,100f/int
             Subsequent commands within the range will move to the next match
             just like vi n/N commands.

     b[#]    Print currently active buffers state or switch to a buffer

             Example: switch to the 5th buffer
             :b5

             There are two temporary buffers which are separate from
             the main buffers.
             b-1 = /hist/ ex history buffer
             b-2 = /fm/ directory listing buffer
             Example: switch to the b-1 buffer
             :b-1
             Example: switch to the b-2 buffer
             :b-2

     bp[path]
             Set current buffer path
     bs[#]   Set current buffer saved. If any arg given, reset undo/redo
             history

     [range]p
             Print line(s) from the buffer

             Example: utilize character offset ranges
             :1,10;5;5p
             Example: print current line from offset 5 to 10
             :.;5;10p

     ea[kwd] [#]
             Open file based on filename substring from dir listing in b-2

             Requires directory listing in b-2 backfilled prior.
             Example: backfill b-2 using :fd
             :fd
             Example: backfill b-2 using find
             :b-2:1,$!find .

             If the substring matches more than one filename, a prompt will
             be shown. Submit using numbers 0-9 (higher ascii values work
             too (<^C> to cancel)). Passing an extra arg to :ea in form of
             a number will bypass the prompt and open the corresponding file.
             Example: open filename containing "v"
             :ea v
             Example: open first match containing "v"
             :ea v 0

     ea![kwd] [#]
             Forced version of ea

     [#]a[str]
     [#]i[str]
     [#]c[str]
             Enter ex {append insert change} mode

             # determines insertion line number.
             str determines initial input into the insertion buffer.

             Example: insert "hello" in vi/ex
             :i hello<^M><ESC>
             Example: discard changes in vi/ex
             :i hello<^C>
             Example: immediately insert "hello"
             :i hello<^V><^M><^V><ESC>
             Example: insert "hello" in raw ex mode
             i hello<^M>.<^M>

     [range]d
             Delete line(s)
     e[path]
             Open a file at a path

             No argument opens "unnamed" buffer.
     e![path]
             Force open a file at a path

             No argument re-reads the current buffer from the filesystem.

     [range]g{*}[kwd]{*}{cmd}
             Global command

             Execute an ex command on a range of lines that matches an
             enclosed regex.

             Example: remove all empty lines
             :g/^$/d

             Multiple ex commands can be chained in one global command.
             To chain commands, the ex separator <:> must be escaped once.
             Example: yank matches appending to reg 'a' and print them out.
             :g/int/ya A\:p

             It is possible to nest global commands inside of global commands.
             A global command will not be executed on lines that were created
             or deleted by a nested global command.
             When range not given, a nested global command is executed on
             the current line.

             Example: Nested global command
             Append "has a semicolon" to all lines that contain "int" and
             end with <;>.
             :g/int/g/;$/& A has a semicolon

             Example: extract/print data enclosed in "()"
             :g/\(.+\)/;0;/\(.+\)/\:.;.+1k a\:se grp=2\:;/\)*(\))/\:
             se nogrp\:k s\:.;'a;'sp

     [range]g!{*}[kwd]{*}{cmd}
             Inverted global command
     [range]=
             Print the current range line number

     [range]k[mark]
             Set a line mark

             The character offset is set to the current position.

     &{macro}
             Global non-blocking macro

             Execute raw vi/ex input sequence.
             A non-blocking macro shall not wait for input when the end of
             the sequence is reached. A non-blocking macro executing other
             macros will always reach a terminating point.
             Example: execute vi insert statement
             :& ihello
             Example: execute :hello
             :& \:hello<^V><^M>
             Example: execute vi ci(int macro
             :& ci(int
             Example: nest blocking macro inside non-blocking
             :& \:@ \\:blocking<^V><^M>i continue in non-blocking

     @{macro}
             Global blocking macro

             Execute raw vi/ex input sequence.
             A blocking macro shall wait for input when the end of the sequence
             is reached. A blocking macro executing other macros may result
             in congestion.
             Example: execute vi insert statement
             :@ ihello
             Example: insert "hello" into <:> vi prompt
             :@ \:hello
             Example: execute vi ci(int macro
             :@ ci(int
             Example: execute ci(int exiting insert mode
             :@ ci(int<^V><^C>
             Example: execute ci)INT as a follow-up
             :@ ci(int<^V><^C>ci)INT
             Example: execute vi dw command after user exits insert
             :@i:@dw

     pu[register] [cmd]
             Paste a register

             To pipe register data to an external process use :pu \![cmd]
             Example: copy default register to X11 clipboard
             :pu \!xclip -selection clipboard

     [range]r[path cmd]
             Read a file or a pipe

             To read data from a pipe use :[range]r \![cmd]
             Example: pipe in only the first line
             :r \!ls
             Example: pipe in only lines 3,5
             :3,5r \!ls
             Example: pipe in all data
             :%r \!ls

     [range]w[path cmd]
             Write to a file or a pipe

             To pipe buffer data to external process use :[range]w \![cmd]
             Example: pipe out all data into less
             :w \!less
             Example: pipe out only first 10 lines
             :1,10w \!less

     [range]w![path]
             Force write to a file

     q       Exit

             :se hll
             :se nohll
             Example: set using numeric values
             :se hll=1
             :se hll=0
             Example: set using ascii values
             :se hll=a

     [range]s{*}[kwd]{*}{str}[*][opts]
             Substitute

             Find and replace text in a range of lines that matches an
             enclosed regex with an enclosed replacement string.

             Example: global replacement
             :%s/term1/term2/g

             Substitution backreference inserts the text of matched group
             specified by \x where x is group number.

             Example: substitution backreference
             this is an example text for subs and has int or void
             :%s/(int)|(void)/pre\0after
             this is an example text for subs and has preintafter or void
             :%s/(int)|(void)/pre\2after/g
             this is an example text for subs and has prepreafterafter or prevoidafter

     [range]ya[register][append]
             Yank a region

             To append to the register, pass in its uppercase version.
             To append to any of the non-alphabetical registers add any extra
             character to the command.
             Example: append to register <1>
             :ya 1x

     ya![register]
             Reset register value

     [range]![cmd]
             Run external program

             When ex range specified, pipes the buffer data to an external
             process and pipes the output back into current buffer replacing
             the affected range.
             Example: infamously sort the buffer
             :1,$!sort

     ft[filetype]
             Set a filetype

             No argument prints the current file type.
             Reloads the highlight ft, which makes it possible to reset dynamic
             highlights created by options like "hlw".

     cm[keymap]
             Set a keymap

             No argument prints the current keymap name.

     cm![keymap]
             Set an alternative keymap

     fd[path]
             Set a secondary directory (stands for file dir)

             Recalculates the directory listing in b-2 buffer.
             No argument implies current directory.

     fp[path]
             Set a directory path for :fd (stands for file path)

     cd[path]
             Set a working directory (stands for change dir)

             Currently open buffers' file paths will be automatically adjusted
             to reflect a newly set working directory.

     inc[regex]
             Include regex for :fd calculation

             Example: include only files in submodule directory that end with .c
             :inc submodule.*\.c$
             Example: exclude the .git and submodule folders
             :inc (^[\!.git\!submodule]+[^\/]+$)
             No argument disables the filter.

     reg[hscroll]
             Print registers and their contents

             Printing position is determined by xcols / 2 * [hscroll]

     bx[#]   Set max number of buffers allowed

             Buffers will be deallocated if the number specified is lower
             than the number of buffers currently in use.
             No argument will reset to the default value of 10.

     ac[regex]
             Set autocomplete filter regex

             Example: autocomplete using whole lines from the buffer
             :ac .+
             No argument resets to the default word filter regex as defined
             in led.c.

     uc      Toggle multibyte utf-8 decoding

             This command is particularly useful when editing files with
             mixed encodings, binary files, or when the terminal does not
             support UTF-8 or lacks the necessary fonts to display UTF-8
             characters. It's often paired with :ph command to achieve
             hex editor-like functionality.

     uz      Toggle zero width placeholders

             Use only if you need to hide zero width characters.

     ub      Toggle combining multicodepoint placeholders

             Use only if your terminal can render multicodepoint utf-8 (emojis).

     ph[#clow] [#chigh] [#width] [#blen][*char]
             Redefine placeholders

             This command replaces placeholders defined in conf.c
             and subsequent :ph commands expand the list of placeholders.
             Example: render 8 bit ascii (Extended ASCII) as <~>
             :ph 128 255 1 1~
             Example: flawless ISO/IEC 8859-1 (latin-1) support
             :uc:ph 128 160 1 1~
             Example: render control byte 03 as "^C"
             :ph 3 3 2 1^C
             Example: reset to default as in conf.c
             :ph
             Example: disable default placeholders in conf.c
             :ph:ph0

EX OPTIONS
     ai=1    Indent new lines
     ic=1    Ignore case in regular expressions

     ish=0   Interactive shell

             Run every <!> command through an interactive shell.
             The shell will source the .rc file before command execution.
             This makes it possible to use predefined functions, aliases
             and ENV variables from the .rc file.
             Precondition 1:
                     The .rc filename is shell specific, such as .bashrc in Bash
                     and .zshrc in Zsh.
             Precondition 2:
                     The environment variable $SHELL determines the default
                     shell, otherwise it defaults to /bin/sh.
             Precondition 3:
                     There must be no stdout output created by .rc file
                     for <!> commands to return expected results.

     grp=0   Regex search group

             Defines a target search group for any regex search operation.
             This becomes necessary when the result of regex search is to
             be based on some group rather than default match group.

             Example: ignore tabs at the start of the line
             :se grp=2:1,$f/^[       ]+(.+):se nogrp

             The value of grp is calculated using (group number * 2).

     hl=1    Highlight text based on rules defined in conf.c
     hlr=0   Highlight text in reverse direction
     hll=0   Highlight current line based on filetype hl
     hlp=0   Highlight "[]" "()" "{}" pairs based on filetype hl
     hlw=0   Highlight current word based on filetype hl
     led=1   Enable all terminal output

     vis=0   Control startup flags

             Example: disable :e message in ex mode
             :se vis=12
             Example: disable :e message in vi mode
             :se vis=8
             Example: enable raw ex mode
             :se vis=6
             Example: disable raw ex mode
             :se vis=4

     mpt=0   Control vi prompts

             When set to 0 after an ex command is called from vi, disables
             the "[any key to continue]" prompt.
             If mpt is negative, the prompt will remain disabled.

     order=1
             Reorder characters based on rules defined in conf.c
     shape=1
             Perform Arabic script letter shaping
     pac=0   Print autocomplete suggestions on the fly
     tbs=8   Number of spaces used to represent a tab
     td=1    Current text direction context

             This option accepts four meaningful values:
             +2      Exclusively left-to-right
             +1      Follow dircontexts[] (in conf.c), defaulting to left-to-
                     right
             -1      Follow dircontexts[], defaulting to right-to-left
             -2      Exclusively right-to-left

     pr=0    Print register

             Set a special register using a character or a number.
             Once the register is set, all data passed into ex_print will
             be stored in the register.
             If the register is uppercase, <Newline> characters are added
             to match the exact output that was printed.
             Example: paste current buffer list exactly like from :b command
             :se pr=A:ya! a:b:pu a
             Example: store a line printed with :p
             :se pr=A:ya! a:p

     sep=:   Ex separator

             Set Ex command separator character.
             Changing default <:> separator will break some built-in commands/macros.
             Example: set separator to <|>
             :se sep=|
             Example: disable separator
             :se nosep

EXINIT ENV VAR
     EXINIT defines a sequence of vi/ex commands to be performed
     at startup. Consequently, this is the primary way for scripting
     and customizing Nextvi outside of C.
     Many standard text processing utils such as grep, awk, sed
     can be replaced by Nextvi with EXINIT in mind.

     Examples:

     export EXINIT=$'e ./vi.c:& i\x7\x3:bx 1:bx'
             Index vi.c for autocomplete

     export EXINIT='b-1:%r ./vi.c:b-1'
             Load vi.c into a history buffer

     export EXINIT=$'e:& io{\n}\x16\x3kA\x3:& 1G:& 2\"ayy'
             Setup @ macro in register <a>

             @a macro creates <{> and closing <}> below the cursor leaving
             cursor in insert mode in between the braces.

REGEX
     Nextvi's regex syntax is akin to that of Plan 9.
     Disregard manpage notation for <{ } [ ]> in this section.

     .       match any single char
     ^       assert start of the line
     $       assert end of the line
     {N,M}   match N to M times
     ()      grouping
     (?:)    non capture grouping
     [N-M]   match a set of alternate ranges N to M
     *       repeated zero or more times
     +       repeated one or more times
     |       union, alternative branch
     \<      assert start of the word
     \>      assert end of the word
     ?       one or zero matches greedy
     ??      one or zero matches lazy

     Additionally, Nextvi supports static lookahead expressions.
     /[=abc]
             find <a> followed by "bc"
     /[!abc]
             find anything except <a> followed by "bc"
     /[!abc!cda!qwe]
             multiple lookahead alternatives in one bracket exp
     /[!abc^=123]
             disable lookahead after "^=" specifier and match [123] normally

SPECIAL MARKS
     *       position of the previous change
     [       first line of the previous change
     ]       last line of the previous change
     '       position of the previous line region
     `       position of the previous line region

SPECIAL REGISTERS
     /       previous search keyword
     :       previous ex command
     0       previous value of default register (atomic)
             Atomic means the operation did not include a <Newline>.
     1-9     previous value(s) of default register (nonatomic)

             build
     ./cbuild.sh debug
             build with -O0 -g
     ./cbuild.sh pgobuild
             PGO build can lead to a significant performance boost on some
             application specific tasks
     ./cbuild.sh install
             install vi to $DESTDIR$PREFIX/bin

PHILOSOPHY
     In most text editors, flexibility is a minor or irrelevant design
     goal. Nextvi is designed to be flexible where the editor adapts
     to the user needs. This flexibility is achieved by heavily chaining
     basic commands and allowing them to create new ones with completely
     different functionality. Command reuse keeps the editor small
     without infringing on your freedom to quickly get a good grasp
     on the code. If you want to customize anything, you should be
     able to do it using only core commands or a mix with some specific
     C code for more difficult tasks. Simple and flexible design
     allows for straight forward solutions to any problem long term
     and filters bad inconsistent ideas.

     Q: What is pikevm?
     A: Pikevm is a complete rewrite of Nextvi's regex engine for
     the purposes of getting rid of backtracking and severe performance
     and memory constraints. Pikevm guarantees that all regular expressions
     are computed in constant space and O(n+k) time where n is size
     of the string and k is some constant for the complexity of the
     regex i.e. number of state transitions. It is important to understand
     that it does not mean that we run at O(n) linear speed, but
     rather the amount of processing time & memory usage is distributed
     evenly and linearly throughout the string, the k constant plays
     a big role. If you are familiar with radix sort algorithms this
     follows the same idea.
     Q: What are the other benefits?
     A: For example, now it is possible to compute a C comment
     /* x */ where x can be an infinite number of characters. Of course,
     this extends to every other valid regular expression.
     Q: New features pikevm supports?
     A: Additionally, pikevm supports PCRE style non capture group
     (?:) and lazy quantifiers like .*? and .+?? because they were
     easy to implement and allow for further regex profiling/optimization.
     Q: NFA vs DFA (identify)
     A: pikevm = NFA backtrack = DFA
     Q: What's wrong with original implementation?
     A: Nothing except it being slow and limited. My improved version
     of Ali's DFA implementation ran 3.5X faster in any case, however
     I found a bug with it where zero quantifier "?" nested groups
     compute wrong submatch results. To fix this problem, it would
     require to undo a lot of optimization work already done, basically
     going back to how slow Ali's implementation would be. The reason
     this was spotted so late was because this kind of regex wasn't
     used before, so I never tested it. Other than that I think submatch
     extraction is correct on other cases. Pikevm does not have this
     bug, so it will be used as main regex engine from now on, unless
     dfa ever finds a proper fix. Honestly, this change isn't so
     surprising, as I was working on pikevm a few months prior, to
     favor a superior algorithm.

     You can still find that code here (likely with no updates):
     https://github.com/kyx0r/nextvi/tree/dfa_dead

     As a downside, NFA simulation loses the DFA property of being
     able to quickly short circuit a match, as everything runs linearly
     and at constant speed, incurring match time overhead. Well optimized
     DFA engine can outperform pikevm, but that is rather rare as
     they got problems of their own. For example as independently
     benchmarked, dfa_dead runs only 13% faster than pikevm and that
     is stretching the limit of what is physically possible on a
     table based matcher. Can't cheat mother nature, and if you dare
     to try she's unforgiving at best.
