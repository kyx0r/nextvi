.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Nextvi
is a
.Xr vi 1 Ns -like
text editor based on Ali Gholami Rudi's
.Xr Neatvi 1 Ns .
VI is a legendary command-line text editor, first introduced
by Bill Joy in 1976, renowned for its modal interface, which
allows users to switch between insert, command, and visual modes
for seamless text manipulation. This powerful and efficient
editor has stood the test of time, remaining a staple tool for
developers and system administrators in Unix and Linux environments,
thanks to its flexibility, customization options, and syntax
similar to other vi/ex editors. To mark its 50th anniversary,
Nextvi emerges as the pinnacle of VI's evolution. This masterpiece
of efficiency and elegance boasts unparalleled startup speed,
unmatched portability, exceptional hackability, and an incredibly
robust macro system, among other features. Nextvi is truly the
next generation of VI, ready to elevate your text editing experience.

.Sh EX
Ex is a powerful line editor for Unix systems, initially developed by Bill Joy in
1976. This essential tool serves as the backbone of vi, enabling it to execute commands,
macros and even transform into a purely command-line interface (CLI) when desired.
In Ex, each command is initiated and separated by <:> prefix.
.
.Sh EX EXPANSION
.Bd -literal -compact
Characters <# %> in ex prompt substitute the buffer pathname.
<%> substitutes current buffer and <#> last swapped buffer.
It is possible to expand any arbitrary buffer by using <# %>
followed by the buffer number.
Example: print the pathname for buffer 69.
:!echo "%69"

Every ex command is be able to receive data from external process
through a special expansion character <!> which pipes the data
into the command itself. If the closing <!> is not specified,
the end of the line becomes a terminator.
Example:
Substitute the value of env var $SECRET to the value of $RANDOM.
In this demo, we set the value of SECRET to "int" ourselves.
:%s/!export SECRET="int" && printf "%s" $SECRET!/!printf "%s" $RANDOM!

.Bd -literal
Example: no range given, current line only
:f/int
Example: reverse
:f?int
Example: range given
:10,100f/int
Subsequent commands within the range will move to the next match
just like vi n/N commands.
.Ed

.It Cm b[\fI#\fP]
Print currently active buffers state or switch to a buffer
.Bd -literal
Example: switch to the 5th buffer
:b5

There are 2 temporary buffers which are separate from
the main buffers.
b-1 = /hist/ ex history buffer
b-2 = /fm/ directory listing buffer
Example: switch to the b-1 buffer
:b-1
Example: switch to the b-2 buffer

.Ed

.It Cm bp [\fIpath\fP]

.It Cm [\fIrange\fP]p
Print line(s) from the buffer
.Bd -literal
Example: utilize character offset ranges
:1,10;5;5p
Example: print current line from offset 5 to 10
:.;5;10p
.Ed

.It Cm ea [\fIkwd\fP] [\fI#\fP]
Open file based on filename substring from dir listing in b-2
.Bd -literal
Requires directory listing in b-2 backfilled prior.
Example: backfill b-2 using :fd
:fd
Example: backfill b-2 using find
:b-2:1,$!find .

If the substring matches more than 1 filename, a prompt will
be shown. Submit using numbers 0-9 (higher ascii values work
too (<^C> to cancel)). Passing an extra arg to :ea in form of
a number will bypass the prompt and open the corresponding file.
Example: open filename containing "v"
:ea v
Example: open first match containing "v"
:ea v 0
.Ed

.It Cm ea![\fIkwd\fP] [\fI#\fP]
Forced version of ea

str determines initial input into the insertion buffer.

Example: insert "hello" in vi/ex
:i hello<^M><ESC>
Example: discard changes in vi/ex
:i hello<^C>
Example: immediately insert "hello"
:i hello<^V><^M><^V><ESC>

enclosed regex.

Example: remove empty lines
:g/^$/d

Multiple ex commands can be chained in one global command.
To chain commands, the ex separator <:> must be escaped once.
Example: yank matches appending to reg 'a' and print them out.
:g/int/ya A\e:p

It is possible to nest global commands inside of global commands.
Example: find all lines with int and a semicolon and append
"has a semicolon"
:g/int/:.g/;/& A has a semicolon
Example: extract/print data enclosed in "()"
:g/\e(.+\e)/;0;/\e(.+\e)/\e:.;.+1k a\e:se grp=2\e:;/\e)*(\e))/\e:

the affected range.
Example: infamously sort the buffer
:1,$!sort

Interactive shell
.Bd -literal
Run every <!> command through an interactive shell.
The shell will source the .rc file before command execution.
This makes it possible to use predefined functions, aliases

.Sh EXINIT ENV VAR
.Bd -literal
EXINIT defines a sequence of vi/ex commands to be performed
at startup. Consequently, this is the primary way for scripting
and customizing Nextvi outside of C.
Many standard text processing utils such as grep, awk, sed
can be replaced by Nextvi with EXINIT in mind.

Examples:
.Ed

.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Cm export EXINIT=$'e ./vi.c:& i\ex7\ex3:bx 1:bx'
Index vi.c for autocomplete

.It Cm export EXINIT='b-1:%r ./vi.c:b-1'
Load vi.c into a history buffer

.It Cm export EXINIT=$'e:& io{\en}\ex16\ex3kA\ex3:& 1G:& 2\e"ayy'
Setup @ macro in register <a>

@a macro creates <{> and closing <}> below the cursor leaving
cursor in insert mode in between the braces.

.Sh PHILOSOPHY
.Bd -literal -compact
In most text editors, flexibility is a minor or irrelevant design goal.
Nextvi is designed to be flexible where the editor adapts to the user needs.
This flexibility is achieved by heavily chaining basic commands and allowing
them to create new ones with completely different functionality. Command
reuse keeps the editor small without infringing on your freedom to quickly
get a good grasp on the code. If you want to customize anything, you should
be able to do it using only core commands or a mix with some specific C code
for more difficult tasks. Simple and flexible design allows for straight
forward solutions to any problem long term and filters bad inconsistent ideas.

Q: What is pikevm?
A: Pikevm is a complete rewrite of Nextvi's regex engine for the purposes of
getting rid of backtracking and severe performance and memory constraints.
Pikevm guarantees that all regular expressions are computed in constant space
and O(n+k) time where n is size of the string and k is some constant for the
complexity of the regex i.e. number of state transitions. It is important to
understand that it does not mean that we run at O(n) linear speed, but rather
the amount of processing time & memory usage is distributed evenly and linearly
throughout the string, the k constant plays a big role. If you are familiar
with radix sort algorithms this follows the same idea.
Q: What are the other benefits?
A: For example, now it is possible to compute a C comment /* n */ where n can
be an infinite number of characters. Of course this extends to every other
valid regular expression.
Q: New features pikevm supports?
A: Additionally, pikevm supports PCRE style non capture group (?:) and lazy
quantifiers like .*? and .+?? because they were easy to implement and allow
for further regex profiling/optimization.
Q: NFA vs DFA (identify)
A: pikevm = NFA backtrack = DFA
Q: What's wrong with original implementation?
A: Nothing except it being slow and limited. My improved version of Ali's DFA
implementation ran 3.5X faster in any case, however I found a bug with it
where zero quantifier "?" nested groups compute wrong submatch results. To
fix this problem, it would require to undo a lot of optimization work already
done, basically going back to how slow Ali's implementation would be. The reason
this was spotted so late was because this kind of regex wasn't used before,
so I never tested it. Other than that I think submatch extraction is correct
on other cases. Pikevm does not have this bug, so it will be used as main
regex engine from now on, unless dfa ever finds a proper fix. Honestly, this
change isn't so surprising, as I was working on pikevm a few months prior, to
favor a superior algorithm.
You can still find that code here (likely with no updates):
.Lk https://github.com/kyx0r/nextvi/tree/dfa_dead
As a downside, NFA simulation loses the DFA property of being able to
quickly short circuit a match, as everything runs linearly and at constant
speed, incurring match time overhead. Well optimized DFA engine can
outperform pikevm, but that is rather rare as they got problems of their own.
For example as independently benchmarked, dfa_dead runs only 13% faster than
pikevm and that is stretching the limit of what is physically possible on a
table based matcher. Can't cheat mother nature, and if you dare to try she's
unforgiving at best.
