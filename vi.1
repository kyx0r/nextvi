Delete text until the 3rd instance of "int" keyword
.It Cm d3w
Delete 3 words
.It Cm \&"ayl

.El
.
.Sh EX
Ex is a line editor for Unix systems originally written by Bill Joy in 1976.
In ex, every command is prefixed with ':'. Ex is essential to vi, which allows it
to run commands and macros. Together vi and ex create a beautiful symbiosis, which
complements each other and helps to solve various domain problems.
.
.Sh EX EXPANSION
.Bd -literal -compact
Characters # and % in ex prompt substitute the buffer pathname.
% substitutes current buffer and # last swapped buffer.
It is possible to expand any arbitrary buffer by using % or
# (no difference in this case) followed by the buffer number.
Example:
print the pathname for buffer 69 (if it exists).
:!echo "%69"

Every ex command is be able to receive data from the outside
world through a special expansion character ! which runs a pipe
command. If the closing ! is not specified, the end of the line
becomes a terminator.
Example:
Substitute the value of env var $SECRET to the value of $RANDOM :).
In this demo, we set the value of SECRET to "int" ourselves.
:%s/!export SECRET="int" && printf "%s" $SECRET!/!printf "%s" $RANDOM! :)
.Ed
.
.Sh EX ESCAPES
Nextvi special character escapes work mostly the same way everywhere
except the following situations:
.Bd -literal -compact
 - Escapes in regex bracket expressions.
 - Due to ex expansion # % and ! characters have to be escaped
   if they are part of an ex command.
 - A single back slash requires 2 back slashes, and so on.
 - regex requires for ( to be escaped if used inside [] brackets.
 - In ex prompt the only separator is "|" character. It can
   be escaped normally but will require extra back slash if passed
   into a regular expression or a global command.
.Ed
.
.Sh EX RANGES
.Bd -literal -compact
Some ex commands can be prefixed with ranges.
Examples:

just like vi n/N commands.
.Ed

.It Cm b[#]
Print currently active buffers state or switch to a buffer
.Bd -literal

If the substring matches more than 1 filename, a prompt will
be shown. Submit using numbers 0-9 (higher ascii values work
too (<^c> to cancel)). Passing an extra arg to :ea in form of
a number will bypass the prompt and open the corresponding file.

Set a special register using a character or a number.
Once the register is set, all data passed into ex_print will
be stored in the register.
If the register is uppercase, new lines are added to match the
exact output that was printed.
Example: paste current buffer list exactly like from :b command
:se pr=A|ya! a|b|pu a
Example: store a line printed with :p
:se pr=A|ya! a|p

.Sh EXINIT ENV VAR
.Bd -literal
EXINIT defines a sequence of vi/ex commands to be performed
at startup. Consequently, this is the primary way for scripting
and customizing nextvi outside of C.
Many standard text processing utils such as grep, awk, sed
can be replaced by nextvi with EXINIT in mind.

Example 1:
There is a dictionary file (assume vi.c), which we always want
to have indexed at startup for autocomplete. The last "bx" commands
delete the vi.c buffer.
export EXINIT=$(printf "e ./vi.c|& i\ex7\ex3|bx 1|bx")

Example 2:
Load some file (assume vi.c) into vi's history buffer.
export EXINIT="b-1|%r ./vi.c|b-1"

Example 3:
Setup a @ macro in register a
When @a is executed the macro will create { and closing } below
the cursor leaving cursor in insert mode in between the braces.
export EXINIT=$(printf "e|& io{\en}\ex16\ex3kA\ex3|& 1G|& 2\e"ayy")

.Sh REGEX
Nextvi's regex syntax is akin to that of Plan 9.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Cm \&.
match any single char
.It Cm ^
assert start of the line
.It Cm $
assert end of the line
.It Cm {N,M}
match N to M times
.It Cm ()
grouping
.It Cm (?:)
non capture grouping
.It Cm [N-M]
match ranges N to M
.It Cm *
repeated zero or more times
.It Cm +
repeated one or more times
.It Cm \&|
union, alternative branch
.It Cm \e<
assert beginning of the word
.It Cm \e>
assert end of the word
.It Cm \&?
one or zero matches greedy
.It Cm \&??
one or zero matches lazy
.El

Additionally, Nextvi's supports static lookahead expressions. For example
[!abc] and [=abc] where ! is negated version of =. This will treat "abc" as (a &&
b && c) logically. It is possible to have multiple in one bracket expression as
well. For example [!abc!cda!qwe] where each string delimited by the ! acts like
a typical or operation i.e. [acq] with only difference of testing the extra characters
ahead. To combine both standard bracket expression and lookahead in one, use ^ or
^= where ^ is negated and ^= is default. For example: [!abc^=123] characters after
^= match exactly how [123] would.

.Sh PHILOSOPHY
.Bd -literal -compact
In most text editors, flexibility is a minor or irrelevant design goal.
Nextvi is designed to be flexible where the editor adapts to the user needs.
This flexibility is achieved by heavily chaining basic commands and allowing
them to create new ones with completely different functionality. Command
reuse keeps the editor small without infringing on your freedom to quickly
get a good grasp on the code. If you want to customize anything, you should
be able to do it using the only core commands or a mix with some specific C
code for more difficult tasks. Simple and flexible design allows for straight
forward solutions to any problem long term and filters bad inconsistent ideas.

Q: What is pikevm?
A: Pikevm is a complete rewrite of nextvi's regex engine for the purposes of
getting rid of backtracking and severe performance and memory constraints.
Pikevm guarantees that all regular expressions are computed in constant space
and O(n+k) time where n is size of the string and k is some constant for the
complexity of the regex i.e. number of state transitions. It is important to
understand that it does not mean that we run at O(n) linear speed, but rather
the amount of processing time & memory usage is distributed evenly and linearly
throughout the string, the k constant plays a big role. If you are familiar
with radix sort algorithms this follows the same idea.
Q: What are the other benefits?
A: For example, now it is possible to compute a C comment /* n */ where n can
be an infinite number of characters. Of course this extends to every other
valid regular expression.
Q: New features pikevm supports?
A: Additionally, pikevm supports PCRE style non capture group (?:) and lazy
quantifiers like .*? and .+?? because they were easy to implement and allow
for further regex profiling/optimization.
Q: NFA vs DFA (identify)
A: pikevm = NFA backtrack = DFA
Q: What's wrong with original implementation?
A: Nothing except it being slow and limited. My improved version of Ali's DFA
implementation ran 3.5X faster in any case, however I found a bug with it
where zero quantifier "?" nested groups compute wrong submatch results. To
fix this problem, it would require to undo a lot of optimization work already
done, basically going back to how slow Ali's implementation would be. The reason
this was spotted so late was because this kind of regex wasn't used before,
so I never tested it. Other than that I think submatch extraction is correct
on other cases. Pikevm does not have this bug, so it will be used as main
regex engine from now on, unless dfa ever finds a proper fix. Honestly, this
change isn't so surprising, as I was working on pikevm a few months prior, to
favor a superior algorithm.
You can still find that code here (likely with no updates):
.Lk https://github.com/kyx0r/nextvi/tree/dfa_dead
As a downside, NFA simulation loses the DFA property of being able to
quickly short circuit a match, as everything runs linearly and at constant
speed, incurring match time overhead. Well optimized DFA engine can
outperform pikevm, but that is rather rare as they got problems of their own.
For example as independently benchmarked, dfa_dead runs only 13% faster than
pikevm and that is stretching the limit of what is physically possible on a
table based matcher. Can't cheat mother nature, and if you dare to try she's
unforgiving at best.
